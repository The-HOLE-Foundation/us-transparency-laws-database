## Your Role as Inspector

### When Agent Completes Work

1. **Navigate to worktree:**
   ```bash
   cd worktrees/affirmative/{jurisdiction}
   ```

2. **Review the data file:**
   ```bash
   cat data/v0.12/rights/{jurisdiction}-rights.json
   ```

3. **Check for errors:**
   - Verify all citations are from official .gov sources
   - Check statute numbers are accurate
   - Ensure descriptions are clear and accurate
   - Confirm categories match schema

4. **If corrections needed:**
   - Update this file: Change status to ⚠️ **Needs Correction**
   - Tell agent what to fix
   - Agent makes corrections in same worktree

5. **If approved:**
   - Update this file: Change status to ✅ **Complete**
   - Merge to main (from main worktree):
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/main
     git merge verification/{jurisdiction}-affirmative
     ```
   - Keep worktree for future statute updates

## Quick Commands

**View all worktrees:**
```bash
git worktree list
```

**Check a jurisdiction's status:**
```bash
cd worktrees/affirmative/{jurisdiction}
git status
git log
```

**Merge completed work:**
```bash
cd /path/to/main
git merge verification/{jurisdiction}-affirmative
```

**DO NOT delete worktrees** - keep them for future statute updates and amendments

Statute Citation: South Dakota Codified Laws (SDCL) Title 1, Chapter 27 - Public Records and Files

LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE

SDCL 1-27-1 - Policy and Intent
The Legislature recognizes that a representative government is dependent upon an informed electorate and that the people have a fundamental right to know about the activities of their government. The Sunshine Law ensures access to public records while protecting legitimate privacy and security interests.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT

Prior to 2009, South Dakota operated under a presumption that all public records were confidential, with the burden on requesters to prove their right to access. Senate Bill 147, signed by Governor Mike Rounds on March 30, 2009, and effective June 1, 2009, reversed this presumption. South Dakota joined the majority of states where records are presumed public unless specifically exempted.

The Better Government Association ranked South Dakota 50th in the nation for transparency in 2008, but these reforms significantly improved the state's transparency framework.

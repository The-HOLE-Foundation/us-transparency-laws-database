    "request_text": "To the CIA Information and Privacy Coordinator:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552, I hereby request access to and copies of declassified records regarding CIA domestic surveillance activities and cooperation with FBI counterintelligence programs from 1950 through 1980.\n\nAs a tenured professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I am conducting scholarly research examining the historical evolution of U.S. intelligence operations and their intersection with domestic civil rights movements. This research will contribute to academic understanding of Cold War-era intelligence practices and inform public discourse about historical government surveillance programs.\n\n**Specific Records Requested:**\n\n1. **Operation CHAOS and Domestic Surveillance Records** including:\n   - All declassified records related to Operation CHAOS (1967-1974)\n   - Domestic intelligence collection activities targeting U.S. citizens\n   - Reports on anti-war protesters and civil rights organizations\n   - Intelligence assessments of domestic political movements\n   - Coordination with FBI on domestic counterintelligence operations\n\n2. **COINTELPRO Coordination and CIA Involvement** including:\n   - CIA participation in or support for FBI COINTELPRO operations\n   - Intelligence sharing agreements between CIA and FBI for domestic operations\n   - Joint surveillance operations targeting political dissidents\n   - CIA assessments of domestic \"subversive\" organizations\n   - Records of CIA domestic activities contrary to agency charter restrictions\n\n3. **University and Academic Surveillance Programs** including:\n   - CIA monitoring of university faculty, students, and research activities\n   - Campus recruitment and surveillance operations\n   - Intelligence collection on academic conferences and research projects\n   - Relationships with university administrators and faculty informants\n   - Records related to campus unrest and anti-war demonstrations\n\n4. **Civil Rights Movement Surveillance** including:\n   - Intelligence collection on civil rights leaders and organizations\n   - Assessments of potential \"communist influence\" in civil rights movements\n   - Surveillance of Southern Christian Leadership Conference, NAACP, and related organizations\n   - International travel monitoring of civil rights leaders\n   - Coordination with state and local law enforcement on civil rights surveillance\n\n5. **Declassification Reviews and Historical Assessments** including:\n   - Church Committee-related materials and responses\n   - Internal CIA historical assessments of domestic operations\n   - Inspector General reports on domestic surveillance activities\n   - Post-1975 reviews of domestic intelligence operations\n   - Records related to congressional oversight and reform efforts\n\n**Academic Research Context:**\n\nThis request supports scholarly research for a forthcoming academic book examining the historical development of U.S. intelligence operations and their impact on civil liberties during the Cold War period. The research has been approved by my university's Institutional Review Board and is supported by a National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship.\n\nI am particularly interested in understanding the institutional mechanisms that led to CIA domestic surveillance activities, the extent of coordination with other agencies, and the historical lessons learned from subsequent oversight and reform efforts.\n\n**Declassification and Processing:**\n\nI understand that many records from this time period have already been reviewed for declassification as part of various historical review programs, including the JFK Records Act releases and ongoing systematic declassification efforts. I request priority review of any additional records that may have become available for release since previous reviews.\n\nFor records that remain classified, I request a line-by-line review to determine if portions can be released with appropriate redactions. Many operational details from this historical period may no longer require protection, and release would serve significant public and academic interest in understanding this important historical period.\n\n**Fee Waiver Request:**\n\nI request a complete fee waiver under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) as this request is made for scholarly research purposes that will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations during a critical historical period. The information will be used exclusively for academic research and publication, with no commercial purpose.\n\nAs a university professor, I am committed to making this research available to students, fellow scholars, and the general public through academic publications, conference presentations, and educational materials.\n\n**Format and Processing Preferences:**\n\nPlease provide responsive records in electronic format (PDF) when possible to facilitate research and analysis. If records are voluminous, I am willing to work with your office to prioritize specific subcategories or time periods to expedite processing.\n\nIf any records are withheld or redacted, please provide a detailed explanation citing specific exemptions and, where appropriate, a Vaughn index describing the nature of withheld materials.\n\nGiven the historical nature of these records and the significant public interest in understanding this period of American history, I respectfully request that exemptions be construed narrowly and that maximum disclosure be provided consistent with legitimate current security concerns.\n\nThank you for your consideration of this request. I look forward to working with your office to facilitate the release of these important historical records.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nDr. Patricia Williams\nProfessor of History\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nDepartment of History\n[ADDRESS]\n[PHONE] | [EMAIL]\n\nEnclosed: Curriculum vitae, university employment verification, NEH fellowship documentation",

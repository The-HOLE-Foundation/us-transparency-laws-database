    "request_text": "To the DEA FOIA/PA Officer:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552, and in connection with pending federal criminal proceedings, I hereby request access to and copies of all records maintained by the Drug Enforcement Administration regarding the investigation of [CLIENT NAME] (DOB: [DATE], SSN: [XXX-XX-XXXX]) and related matters.\n\nI am the attorney of record representing [CLIENT NAME] in United States v. [CLIENT NAME], Case No. [XX-XXX-XX], pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, before the Honorable [JUDGE NAME].\n\n**Specific Records Requested:**\n\n1. **Investigation Case Files** including:\n   - All DEA case reports and investigative summaries\n   - Agent notes, memoranda, and observations\n   - Evidence logs and chain of custody documentation\n   - Laboratory analysis reports and forensic testing results\n   - Surveillance reports and operational summaries\n\n2. **Electronic Surveillance Records** including:\n   - Title III wiretap applications, orders, and transcripts\n   - Pen register and trap and trace device records\n   - Cell-site location information (CSLI) requests and data\n   - Email and digital communication intercepts\n   - Video surveillance footage and photographs\n\n3. **Confidential Source Records** including:\n   - Confidential informant (CI) agreements and payments\n   - Source reliability assessments and validation reports\n   - Communications between agents and confidential sources\n   - Source debriefing reports and intelligence summaries\n   - (Note: Source identities may be redacted consistent with exemptions)\n\n4. **Multi-Agency Coordination Records** including:\n   - Joint operation reports with local, state, or federal agencies\n   - Task force participation and intelligence sharing\n   - Correspondence with U.S. Attorney's Office regarding prosecution\n   - Communication with other federal agencies (FBI, ATF, IRS, etc.)\n\n5. **Administrative and Procedural Records** including:\n   - Search warrant applications, affidavits, and returns\n   - Asset forfeiture documentation and proceedings\n   - Brady/Giglio material and disciplinary records of involved agents\n   - Quality assurance reviews and supervisory approval documents\n\n**Legal Basis and Justification:**\n\nThis request is made in connection with ongoing federal criminal proceedings where I serve as defense counsel. Under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), the government has a constitutional obligation to disclose material exculpatory and impeachment evidence.\n\nWhile formal discovery will be addressed through criminal proceedings under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16, this FOIA request seeks to ensure comprehensive access to all potentially relevant materials, including those that may not be within the immediate possession of prosecutors but exist in agency files.\n\n**Confidential Source Protection:**\n\nI acknowledge that source identities and methods may be protected under FOIA Exemption 7(D) and request that such information be redacted rather than withholding entire documents. Non-identifying information about source reliability, payments, and general operational details should be disclosed to the extent possible.\n\n**Processing Requests:**\n\nI request expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(6)(E)(i) as this matter involves pending federal criminal proceedings where delay could result in due process violations and irreparable harm to my client's constitutional rights.\n\nI am prepared to pay reasonable fees associated with processing this request. As counsel in a federal criminal case, I request that fees be waived or reduced consistent with the public interest in ensuring constitutional due process protections.\n\nIf any records are withheld, please provide a detailed Vaughn index describing the withheld materials and specific exemptions claimed. Please segregate non-exempt portions of any partially exempt documents.\n\nGiven the time-sensitive nature of criminal proceedings, please provide an estimated timeline for completion and contact me immediately if there are any processing issues or questions.\n\nEnclosed please find a copy of the criminal indictment, my notice of appearance as counsel, and court scheduling order establishing relevant deadlines.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMichael Rodriguez, Esq.\nFlorida Bar No. [NUMBER]\nAttorney for Defendant [CLIENT NAME]\n[LAW FIRM NAME]\n[ADDRESS]\n[PHONE] | [EMAIL]",

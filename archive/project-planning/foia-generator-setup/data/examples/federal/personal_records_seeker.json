Enclosed please find Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, signed by my client authorizing this request.\n\nAs this request involves records pertaining to my client's ongoing legal proceedings, I respectfully request that processing be expedited under 8 C.F.R. § 103.10(b)(1)(ii) due to urgency involving a person primarily engaged in disseminating information with urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged federal government activity.\n\nIf any portion of this request is denied, please specify which exemption(s) apply and provide a detailed explanation. If fees are anticipated to exceed $25, please contact me before processing.

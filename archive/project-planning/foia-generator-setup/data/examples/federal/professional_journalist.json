The information sought is of significant public interest regarding government transparency and the policy-making process.\n\nI request expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(6)(E) as this request involves \"a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" The pharmaceutical industry's influence on healthcare policy is a matter of urgent public concern, particularly regarding drug pricing and access to medications.\n\nI also request a fee waiver under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) as I am a member of the news media and this information will be used for public education through publication in a nationally distributed news publication.

Given the public interest in government transparency, please construe exemptions narrowly.\n\nPlease provide records in electronic format when possible.

    "request_text": "To the San Francisco Police Department Legal Division:\\n\\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, Government Code Section 6250 et seq., I hereby request access to and copies of records related to police use of force incidents and officer disciplinary actions from 2022 to the present.\\n\\nI am an attorney representing [CLIENT NAME] in a federal civil rights lawsuit (Case No. [XX-XXXX]) pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California regarding an alleged excessive force incident involving SFPD officers.\\n\\n**Specific Records Requested:**\\n\\n1. **Use of Force Reports and Documentation:**\\n   - All use of force reports involving Officers [NAMES] from 2022-2024\\n   - Incident reports and supplemental documentation\\n   - Body-worn camera footage and dash camera recordings\\n   - Witness statements and evidence documentation\\n   - Supervisory review reports and chain of command analysis\\n\\n2. **Officer Personnel and Disciplinary Records:**\\n   - Disciplinary history for involved officers (Pitchess motion may follow)\\n   - Training records related to use of force and de-escalation\\n   - Performance evaluations and supervisory notes\\n   - Previous complaints and investigations involving these officers\\n   - Commendations and awards (for impeachment/credibility purposes)\\n\\n3. **Department Policies and Training Materials:**\\n   - Current use of force policies and procedures\\n   - Training bulletins and updates issued 2022-2024\\n   - De-escalation training curricula and materials\\n   - Body-worn camera policies and activation requirements\\n   - Internal affairs investigation procedures\\n\\n**Legal Basis and Civil Rights Context:**\\n\\nThis request is made in connection with ongoing federal civil rights litigation under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. The requested records are essential for establishing patterns of conduct, training deficiencies, and supervisory failures relevant to municipal liability claims.\\n\\nUnder Brady v. Maryland and Giglio v. United States, law enforcement agencies have obligations to preserve and disclose material evidence that may be relevant to criminal proceedings. While this is a civil case, similar transparency principles support disclosure of records relevant to police accountability and public oversight.\\n\\n**Processing and Fees:**\\n\\nAs counsel in a civil rights case seeking to vindicate constitutional rights, I request that fees be waived or reduced in the public interest. This case involves matters of significant public concern regarding police accountability and the protection of civil rights.\\n\\nIf fees cannot be waived, I am prepared to pay reasonable costs associated with processing this request up to $500 without pre-approval.\\n\\n**Confidentiality and Privacy Considerations:**\\n\\nI acknowledge that some personnel records may require a Pitchess motion under Evidence Code ยง 1043. However, use of force reports, policies, and training materials are generally subject to disclosure under CPRA.\\n\\nFor any records containing personal information of uninvolved third parties, please redact such information while providing the substantive content relevant to police conduct and department operations.\\n\\nPlease provide records in electronic format when possible. If you anticipate any delays or have questions about this request, please contact me immediately given the litigation timeline.\\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n\\nDavid Chen, Esq.\\nState Bar No. [NUMBER]\\nCivil Rights Law Group\\n[ADDRESS]\\n[PHONE] | [EMAIL]",

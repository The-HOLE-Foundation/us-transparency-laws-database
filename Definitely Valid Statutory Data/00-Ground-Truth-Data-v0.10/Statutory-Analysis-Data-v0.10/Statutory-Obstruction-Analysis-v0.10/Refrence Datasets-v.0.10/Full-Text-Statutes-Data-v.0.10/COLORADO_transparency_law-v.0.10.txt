(1)(a) All public records shall be open for inspection by any person at reasonable times, except as provided in this part 2 or as otherwise specifically provided by law.

(b) The custodian shall make available a suitable place for the inspection of public records, and no person shall remove original public records from such designated place without the permission of the custodian.

(2) Any person may inspect any public record upon written application to the custodian. Such application need only describe the record requested with sufficient specificity to enable the custodian to locate the requested record.

(3) The custodian shall provide the requested records or shall deny the request in writing within three working days after the receipt of the application. If extenuating circumstances exist, the custodian may extend such three-day period for up to seven additional working days by providing written notice of the extension to the applicant within the initial three-working-day period and by stating the reasons for the extension in such written notice.

(4)(a) If the requested records are not in the custodian's immediate custody or control, the custodian may so advise the applicant and shall make reasonable efforts to notify the applicant where the records are located.

(b) If the custodian has transferred permanent custody of the requested records to the state archives, the custodian shall so advise the applicant.

(5)(a) If the custodian denies a records request, the custodian shall provide a written statement of the grounds for denial, including the specific statutory citation to an exemption in section 24-72-204.

(b) Prior to seeking judicial review of the denial, a person denied access to records may file a written request with the custodian for reconsideration of the denial. Such request for reconsideration may include an offer to meet and confer with the custodian to discuss the scope and basis of the request.

(6) The custodian may charge a research and retrieval fee if more than one hour of staff time is necessary to produce the requested records for inspection or copying, except that no research and retrieval fee shall be charged for the first hour of staff time.

(7) All public records that are maintained in electronic or digital form shall be available in that form when technologically practicable.

(1) Any person denied the right to inspect a record covered by this part 2 may apply to the district court of the district wherein the record is found for an order directing the custodian to show cause why the custodian should not be ordered to permit the inspection of such record. Such application may be made after the person has requested reconsideration from the custodian as provided in section 24-72-203(5)(b) and after a period of fourteen days has passed since the request for reconsideration was received by the custodian, or after the custodian has denied the request for reconsideration, whichever occurs first.

(2) Such application shall be filed and served in the manner provided by the Colorado rules of civil procedure and the hearing thereon shall be held at the earliest possible time.

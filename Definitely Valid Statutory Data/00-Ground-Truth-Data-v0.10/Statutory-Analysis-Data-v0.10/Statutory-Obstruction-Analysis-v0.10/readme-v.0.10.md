s project will consist of an in depth analysis of each state's statutory transparency laws. The first step will be identifying the text in each state's statute that is ripe for misuse for the purpose not of lawfully disclosing public records, but unlawfully cocealing them. Even the very best laws are prone to misuse by corrupt officials. In texas, for instance, the statute allows for a pause in the statutory deadline if the original pubic nformation request is not clear enough for the agency to comply. This is necessary as ofcourse you cannot hold an agency to their statutory deadline if they were not provided with sufficient information needed to comply in the first place. However, what happens when the agency simply doesn't want to comply and so they feign lack of understanding and request clarification? Well, that is exactly what happens. There are going to be loopholes in all of these laws. This projects aim is to find what they are and to anticipate how these differen agencies will try to evade their obligation to disclose records. 
eview the documents in this folder, and follow the instructions. At the end you should have files in several formats for each state. There should be a files seperating the data by state. for isntance 
  wyoming and you should create the data in multiple formats to make it suitable for future use. you should make csv files to make it suitable for import into notion and supabase, and you should create json 
  files to tstructure the data for use in ai training of a foia generator agent in the future. Additionaly you should then at the end compile a master datasets in these same formats containing all the data 
  for all jurisdictions in single files of csv/json/etc.

# Version 0.12 Territory Expansion Research Memorandum

**Project**: US Transparency Laws Database
**Version**: 0.12 (Territory Expansion Release)
**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Status**: Research Phase - Pre-Implementation
**Author**: HOLE Foundation Research Team
**Document Type**: Official Research Memorandum for Public Release

---

## Executive Summary

The US Transparency Laws Database currently provides comprehensive coverage of transparency and freedom of information laws across 51 jurisdictions: the 50 states, District of Columbia, and federal government. However, this coverage excludes **5.4 million US residents** living in territories who are subject to distinct legal frameworks for accessing government records.

This memorandum documents research findings for **Version 0.12**, which will expand database coverage to include US territories. Our investigation reveals a **two-tier transparency system** where some territories have enacted robust freedom of information statutes while others may lack any statutory mechanism for residents to access local government records‚Äîa significant democratic accountability gap.

### Key Findings

**Territory FOIA Status**:
- ‚úÖ **3 territories confirmed** with enacted transparency laws: Puerto Rico, Guam, US Virgin Islands
- ‚ùå **2 territories unconfirmed**: Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa require critical research
- üî¥ **Transparency gap identified**: Territories without local FOIA statutes leave residents with no guaranteed right to access local government records

**International Context**:
- üåç **US global ranking**: #23 out of 150+ countries evaluated (112/150 points)
- ü•á **World leaders**: Mexico and Sweden (136/150 points each)
- üìä **US position**: Stronger than UK/Canada/Germany, weaker than Mexico/Sweden/Serbia/India

**Database Expansion**:
- Current: **51 jurisdictions** ‚Üí Target: **54-56 jurisdictions**
- New entries: Puerto Rico, Guam, US Virgin Islands, plus CNMI and American Samoa (pending research)
- Estimated research effort: **82-102 hours** for complete validation

## Part I: The Territory Transparency Problem

### 1.1 Constitutional and Legal Status

US territories occupy a unique constitutional position. While residents are US citizens (except American Samoa, where residents are US nationals), territories are not states and thus state-level transparency norms do not automatically apply. The federal Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. ¬ß 552) covers federal agencies but does **not extend to territorial governments**.

This creates a critical question: **What happens when a US territory lacks its own freedom of information law?**

### 1.2 The Two-Tier Transparency System

Our research reveals a problematic two-tier system:

**Tier 1: Federal Records**
- Accessible via federal FOIA (5 U.S.C. ¬ß 552)
- Applies to federal agencies operating in territories
- 20 business day response time
- Established appeal mechanisms
- Judicial review available

**Tier 2: Local Territorial Records**
- **Only accessible if territory has enacted local FOIA statute**
- If no local statute exists:
  - ‚ùå No statutory right to access
  - ‚ùå No appeal mechanism
  - ‚ùå No judicial enforcement
  - ‚ùå Agencies have complete discretion

### 1.3 Real-World Implications

**For territories without FOIA statutes**, residents face severe transparency barriers:

- **Journalists** cannot compel document production for investigative reporting
- **Researchers** cannot access public health, education, or environmental data
- **Citizens** cannot verify how tax dollars are spent
- **Whistleblowers** lack legal protection for disclosing government wrongdoing
- **Courts** have no basis to order document release
- **Democratic accountability** is fundamentally weakened

**Population affected**: Potentially 200,000+ residents (CNMI: ~47,000, American Samoa: ~49,000) if these territories lack comprehensive transparency laws.

#### Unique Characteristics

**Bilingual Jurisdiction**:
- Spanish is the primary official language
- Requests may be submitted in Spanish or English
- Statutory text exists in both languages (Spanish is authoritative)
- Database must accommodate bilingual documentation

**Transparency Ratings**:
- **RTI Rating**: Estimated 87-106/150 points (not officially rated)
- **Ranking**: Below US federal standard (~112/150)
- **Critics' Assessment**: "Weaker than many national laws" (Centro de Periodismo Investigativo)

**Implementation Challenges**:
- Agency non-compliance reported
- Enforcement mechanisms criticized as inadequate
- Fee waivers difficult to obtain in practice
- Appeals process can take years

**Technical Considerations**:
- UTF-8 encoding required for Spanish characters (√°, √©, √≠, √≥, √∫, √±, √º)
- Consider separate statutory text files: `PUERTO_RICO_transparency_law_spanish-v0.12.txt` and `PUERTO_RICO_transparency_law_english-v0.12.txt`
- Agency names may differ in Spanish vs English official translations

**Validation Priority**: üî¥ **HIGH** - Largest territory by population, significant democratic deficit if documentation incomplete

---

### 2.2 Guam üá¨üá∫

**Population**: 171,000
**Status**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED - Has Transparency Law**
**Research Confidence**: Medium (requires statutory text verification)

#### Legal Framework

**Primary Statute**: 5 Guam Code Annotated (GCA) Chapter 10
- **Popular Name**: "Sunshine Reform Act of 1999"
- **Also Known As**: Guam Freedom of Information Act
- **Effective Date**: 1999
- **Codification**: 5 GCA ¬ß¬ß 10101-10118
- **Legislative History**: Comprehensive reform combining FOIA with open meetings law

#### Unique Features

**Hybrid Sunshine/FOIA Statute**:
Unlike most jurisdictions that have separate freedom of information acts and open meetings laws, Guam's Sunshine Reform Act **combines both**:
- **Part A**: Access to government records (FOIA provisions)
- **Part B**: Open meetings requirements (Sunshine provisions)

This integrated approach reflects Guam's commitment to comprehensive government transparency.

#### Current Research Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **STATUTORY TEXT REQUIRED** - Full analysis pending official source verification

**Known Information**:
- Statute exists and is actively enforced
- Covers all branches of Guam government
- Includes both records access and open meetings
- Response times, fees, and exemptions: **research needed**

**Unknown/Unverified**:
- Exact response time requirements
- Fee structure and waiver provisions
- Specific exemptions from disclosure
- Appeal process and judicial review standards
- Designated FOIA officer or office

#### Official Sources

**Primary Legislative**:
- Guam Legislature: https://www.guamlegislature.com/
- Compiler of Laws (official code): Available through Guam Courts website

**Judicial**:
- Guam Unified Court System: https://www.guamcourts.org/
- Supreme Court of Guam: Publishes opinions interpreting Sunshine Act

**Administrative**:
- Office of the Governor: https://governor.guam.gov/
- Attorney General: https://www.guamag.org/

#### Database Requirements for v0.12

**Critical Data Collection**:
- [ ] **PRIORITY**: Obtain full text of 5 GCA Chapter 10 (¬ß¬ß10101-10118)
- [ ] Identify designated FOIA officer or responsible agency
- [ ] Map all agencies subject to Sunshine Reform Act
- [ ] Document implementing regulations (if any)
- [ ] Research Guam Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Act
- [ ] Verify interaction with federal FOIA for federal agencies on Guam
- [ ] Document open meetings provisions (if including in database scope)

**Technical Considerations**:
- Statute may be lengthy (18 sections) - ensure complete capture
- Separate FOIA provisions from open meetings provisions in documentation
- Consider whether open meetings data should be in separate schema field

**Validation Priority**: üî¥ **HIGH** - Significant population, confirmed statute requires verification

---

### 2.3 US Virgin Islands üáªüáÆ

**Population**: 87,000
**Status**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED - Has Transparency Law**
**Research Confidence**: Medium (requires statutory text verification)

#### Legal Framework

**Primary Statute**: Virgin Islands Public Records Act
- **Codification**: 3 Virgin Islands Code (V.I.C.) ¬ß¬ß 881-884
- **Title**: Title 3, Chapter 33 - Public Records
- **Statute Length**: Only **4 sections** (unusually brief)
- **Legislative History**: Research needed

#### Unique Characteristics

**Extremely Brief Statute**:
At only 4 statutory sections, the USVI Public Records Act is one of the shortest FOIA-type statutes in US jurisdictions. This brevity suggests:
- Heavy reliance on implementing regulations for operational details
- Possible gaps in procedural protections
- Potential for broad agency discretion in interpretation

**Comparison to BVI**:
The US Virgin Islands (USVI) is distinct from the British Virgin Islands (BVI), which is a separate British Overseas Territory. BVI has proposed its own Freedom of Information Act, but this is legally separate from USVI law.

#### Current Research Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **STATUTORY TEXT REQUIRED** - Full analysis pending official source verification

**Known Information**:
- Statute codified at 3 V.I.C. ¬ß¬ß 881-884
- Applies to USVI government entities
- Only 4 sections suggest reliance on regulations

**Unknown/Unverified**:
- Exact scope of covered agencies
- Response time requirements (if specified)
- Fee structure (if specified)
- Exemptions from disclosure (if specified)
- Appeal process (if specified)
- Whether regulations provide operational details

#### Official Sources

**Primary Legislative**:
- Virgin Islands Legislature: https://www.legvi.org/
- Virgin Islands Code online: Availability uncertain - may require request

**Judicial**:
- Virgin Islands Supreme Court: https://visupremecourt.org/
- District Court of the Virgin Islands (federal): May have cases interpreting statute

**Administrative**:
- Office of the Governor: https://www.vi.gov/
- Attorney General: https://doj.vi.gov/

**Research Resources**:
- MuckRock Virgin Islands Public Records Guide: https://www.muckrock.com/place/united-states-of-america/virgin-islands/ (secondary source - verify with official)

#### Database Requirements for v0.12

**Critical Data Collection**:
- [ ] **PRIORITY**: Obtain full text of 3 V.I.C. ¬ß¬ß 881-884 (all 4 sections)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Research implementing regulations (likely essential for operational details)
- [ ] Identify FOIA officer or responsible agency in USVI government
- [ ] Map all agencies subject to Public Records Act
- [ ] Research case law interpreting the statute (if any)
- [ ] Compare with federal FOIA to identify gaps
- [ ] Document practical request procedures regardless of statutory brevity

**Technical Considerations**:
- Brief statute may require extensive regulation documentation
- Consider creating "statutory_gaps" field to note areas not covered by statute
- May need separate entry for regulations vs. statute itself

**Validation Priority**: üü° **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Confirmed statute but unusual brevity requires careful analysis

---

### 2.4 Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) üá≤üáµ

**Population**: 47,000
**Status**: ‚ùå **UNCONFIRMED - No Comprehensive FOIA Statute Identified**
**Research Confidence**: Low (requires comprehensive code search)

#### Current Research Status

üî¥ **CRITICAL RESEARCH GAP** - No freedom of information statute has been identified through preliminary research. This represents a potential **transparency crisis** for 47,000 US citizens.

#### Constitutional Framework

**CNMI Constitution, Article I, Section 10**:
> "The right of the people to privacy shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling interest."

**Analysis**:
- Constitutional privacy protections exist
- **No explicit constitutional right to access government records**
- Privacy provision may actually *limit* government transparency
- Absence of affirmative transparency right is concerning

#### Possible Legal Mechanisms (All Unconfirmed)

**1. Commonwealth Code Scattered Provisions**:
- CNMI may have public records provisions scattered throughout code
- No comprehensive FOIA-style chapter identified
- Requires systematic search of entire Commonwealth Code

**2. Administrative Procedures Act**:
- CNMI may have APA-style provisions allowing some record access
- Typically much weaker than dedicated FOIA statutes
- Research needed in CNMI administrative law title

**3. Common Law Access**:
- Some jurisdictions recognize common law right to inspect public records
- Much weaker than statutory rights (no appeal, no enforcement)
- CNMI Supreme Court case law research required

**4. Federal FOIA (Limited Application)**:
- Covers federal agencies operating in CNMI
- **Does NOT cover**:
  - CNMI government agencies
  - CNMI Legislature
  - CNMI Courts (non-federal)
  - Local law enforcement
  - Municipal governments

#### Transparency Gap Implications

**If CNMI lacks a comprehensive FOIA statute**, residents face:

- ‚ùå **No statutory right to access records** from:
  - Governor's office
  - CNMI Legislature (Secretariat of Government)
  - Department of Public Safety
  - Department of Finance
  - All executive departments
  - Municipal governments (Saipan, Tinian, Rota)

- ‚ùå **No appeal mechanism** for denied requests
- ‚ùå **No judicial enforcement** of access rights
- ‚ùå **No fee limitations** - agencies could charge prohibitive amounts
- ‚ùå **No response time requirements** - indefinite delays possible
- ‚ùå **No exemption standards** - complete agency discretion

**Democratic Accountability Impact**:
This represents a significant democratic deficit. Residents cannot:
- Investigate government corruption
- Verify public spending
- Access environmental impact studies
- Review police misconduct records
- Monitor regulatory decision-making
- Obtain public health data

#### Official Sources for Research

**Primary Legislative**:
- CNMI Legislature: https://cnmileg.gov.mp/
- CNMI Law Revision Commission: https://cnmilaw.org/ (code database)

**Judicial**:
- CNMI Supreme Court: https://www.cnmisupremecourt.gov.mp/
- Commonwealth Superior Court: Case law may interpret access rights

**Administrative**:
- Office of the Governor: https://governor.gov.mp/
- Attorney General's Office: Could provide guidance on public records access

#### Database Requirements for v0.12

**CRITICAL Research Tasks** (Blocking v0.12 Release):
- [ ] üî¥ **PRIORITY 1**: Systematic search of entire CNMI Commonwealth Code for public records provisions
- [ ] üî¥ **PRIORITY 1**: Contact CNMI Attorney General's office for official guidance on records access
- [ ] üî¥ **PRIORITY 2**: Research CNMI Supreme Court decisions on public access to records
- [ ] üî¥ **PRIORITY 2**: Review administrative procedures act for access provisions
- [ ] üî¥ **PRIORITY 3**: Document common law access rights (if any)

**Decision Point for v0.12**:
If research confirms no FOIA statute exists, database must decide:

**Option A**: Include CNMI as "No Local FOIA Statute" with:
- Documentation of transparency gap
- Federal FOIA coverage noted
- Common law access documented (if any)
- Advocacy recommendation for statute adoption

**Option B**: Exclude CNMI pending statute adoption
- Note in documentation why excluded
- Advocate for legislative action
- Add in future version when statute enacted

**Recommended**: **Option A** - Transparency about lack of transparency is itself valuable data

**Validation Priority**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Confirms or disproves transparency gap affecting 47,000 people

---

### 2.5 American Samoa üá¶üá∏

**Population**: 49,000
**Status**: ‚ùå **UNCONFIRMED - No FOIA Statute Identified**
**Research Confidence**: Very Low (requires on-the-ground research)

#### Current Research Status

üî¥ **CRITICAL RESEARCH GAP** - No freedom of information statute identified. American Samoa presents the **most challenging research case** of all territories due to:
- Limited online legal resources
- Unique constitutional status (unincorporated/unorganized territory)
- Traditional governance system (fa'a Samoa) affecting Western legal concepts
- Geographic isolation complicating research access

#### Constitutional and Legal Status

**Unique Territorial Status**:
- **Unincorporated Territory**: US Constitution does not fully apply
- **Unorganized Territory**: No Organic Act from Congress defining powers
- **US Nationals, Not Citizens**: Residents are US nationals unless naturalized
- **Different Constitutional Relationship**: Self-governance under traditional Samoan law

**Traditional Governance (Fa'a Samoa)**:
American Samoa maintains traditional Samoan governance structures:
- **Fono (Legislature)**: Includes Senate of matai (chiefs) and House of Representatives
- **Matai System**: Traditional chiefs hold significant authority
- **Communal Land Ownership**: 90%+ of land held under traditional title
- **Fa'a Samoa (Samoan Way)**: Traditional customs have legal force

**Implications for Transparency Law**:
Western FOIA concepts may not align well with traditional Samoan governance:
- Collective vs. individual information rights
- Chief authority vs. democratic transparency
- Traditional confidentiality norms vs. open government
- Oral tradition vs. written records

#### Possible Legal Mechanisms (All Unconfirmed)

**1. American Samoa Code Provisions**:
- American Samoa Code may contain public records provisions
- **Online availability uncertain** - may require physical access or official request
- No comprehensive FOIA-style statute identified in available sources

**2. Traditional Governance Mechanisms**:
- Village councils (fono) may have customary transparency norms
- Matai may have traditional obligations to share information
- Fa'a Samoa may provide informal access mechanisms
- **Research required**: Interview with cultural/legal experts

**3. Federal FOIA (Very Limited)**:
- Covers federal agencies operating in American Samoa
- **Does NOT cover**:
  - American Samoa Government
  - Fono (Legislature)
  - High Court of American Samoa
  - Local departments
  - Village governments

**4. Territorial Constitution**:
- Revised Constitution of American Samoa research needed
- May contain transparency-related provisions
- Available online: https://www.americansamoa.gov/

#### Research Challenges

**Limited Online Resources**:
- American Samoa Code online availability uncertain
- Historical legislative records scarce
- Case law from High Court of American Samoa not systematically published
- Government websites have limited legal databases

**Cultural Considerations**:
- Western FOIA research methodology may not capture traditional access mechanisms
- Interviews with Samoan legal scholars essential
- Understanding fa'a Samoa context required for accurate assessment
- Language barriers (Samoan and English both official languages)

**Geographic Barriers**:
- 7 time zones from US mainland
- Limited direct communication with government offices
- May require on-the-ground research visit
- Academic partnerships with University of the South Pacific may assist

#### Official Sources for Research

**Primary Government**:
- American Samoa Government: https://www.americansamoa.gov/
- American Samoa Fono: Limited online presence (may require direct contact)
- Office of the Governor: Contact information available on gov website

**Judicial**:
- High Court of American Samoa: https://ashighcourt.org/
- Case law database availability uncertain

**Administrative**:
- Attorney General: Legal guidance on records access (if available)

**Cultural/Academic Resources**:
- University of the South Pacific (American Samoa Campus): Legal scholars
- Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute: https://www.paclii.org/

#### Database Requirements for v0.12

**CRITICAL Research Tasks** (Blocking v0.12 Release):
- [ ] üî¥ **PRIORITY 1**: Contact American Samoa Attorney General for official guidance on records access laws
- [ ] üî¥ **PRIORITY 1**: Obtain access to American Samoa Code (online or physical)
- [ ] üî¥ **PRIORITY 2**: Consult with legal scholars familiar with American Samoa law and fa'a Samoa
- [ ] üî¥ **PRIORITY 2**: Research High Court decisions on public access to records
- [ ] üî¥ **PRIORITY 3**: Document traditional governance mechanisms for information access
- [ ] üî¥ **PRIORITY 3**: Determine practical procedures for accessing government records

**Cultural Competency Requirements**:
- Research team must understand fa'a Samoa context
- Consultation with Samoan community essential
- Avoid imposing Western transparency frameworks inappropriately
- Document both formal and informal access mechanisms

**Decision Point for v0.12**:
Similar to CNMI, if research confirms no FOIA statute:

**Option A**: Include as "No Local FOIA Statute / Traditional Governance System" with:
- Documentation of formal absence of FOIA
- Description of traditional access mechanisms (if any)
- Cultural context explanation
- Federal FOIA coverage noted
- Recommendation for culturally-appropriate transparency legislation

**Option B**: Exclude pending further research
- Note in documentation that American Samoa requires specialized research
- Seek academic partnership for proper cultural assessment
- Add in v0.13 or later with comprehensive analysis

**Recommended**: **Option A** - With clear documentation of research limitations and cultural context

**Validation Priority**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - But requires specialized cultural competency and may need academic partnership

## Part III: Default Access Mechanisms and the Transparency Gap

### 3.1 When Federal FOIA Applies (and When It Doesn't)

**Federal FOIA Coverage in Territories**:

‚úÖ **What IS Covered**:
- US Department of Interior (administers territories)
- Federal courts (District Courts in territories)
- Federal law enforcement (FBI, DEA, ATF, etc.)
- Social Security Administration
- Veterans Affairs
- US Postal Service
- Federal grant programs (partial - only federal agency records)

‚ùå **What is NOT Covered**:
- Territorial executive departments (Governor, agencies)
- Territorial legislatures (Fono, Commonwealth Legislature, etc.)
- Territorial courts (High Court, Superior Court, Supreme Court)
- Local law enforcement (CNMI Dept of Public Safety, AS Dept of Public Safety)
- Municipal/village governments
- Territorial public schools (unless federal grant records)
- Territorial hospitals and health departments
- Territorial environmental agencies

### 3.2 The "Gray Zone" of Agency Discretion

**When no local FOIA statute exists**, territorial agencies may still voluntarily disclose records, but:

**No Legal Obligation**:
- Agency can deny request for any reason or no reason
- No required response time
- No fee limitations
- No exemption standards to meet
- No judicial review of denials

**Complete Discretion**:
- Agency decides what is "public"
- Agency decides what to charge
- Agency decides when (or if) to respond
- No accountability mechanism

**Practical Reality**:
- Cooperative agencies may provide access informally
- Uncooperative agencies face no consequences for refusal
- Access depends on personal relationships, not legal rights
- Inconsistent treatment across agencies and requesters

### 3.3 Common Law Public Records Access

Some jurisdictions recognize **common law right to inspect public records** even without statute. However:

**Severe Limitations**:
- No appeal process
- No enforcement mechanism (courts rarely order disclosure)
- Narrow scope (typically only financial records and meeting minutes)
- Agency can claim exemption broadly
- Fees can be prohibitive
- No response time requirement

**Comparison to Statutory FOIA**:
| Feature | Statutory FOIA | Common Law Access |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Right to access | ‚úÖ Guaranteed by law | ‚ö†Ô∏è Court-recognized but weak |
| Response time | ‚úÖ Specified (e.g., 20 days) | ‚ùå None |
| Fee limits | ‚úÖ Statutory caps | ‚ùå None |
| Appeal process | ‚úÖ Administrative + judicial | ‚ùå Direct to court (expensive) |
| Exemptions | ‚úÖ Defined by statute | ‚ö†Ô∏è Broad agency discretion |
| Enforcement | ‚úÖ Courts can order release | ‚ùå Courts reluctant to intervene |
| Penalties for non-compliance | ‚úÖ Contempt, discipline | ‚ùå None |

**Conclusion**: Common law access is **not an adequate substitute** for comprehensive FOIA statute.

## Part IV: International Transparency Comparison

### 4.1 Global Transparency Rankings

**Right to Information (RTI) Rating System**:
The RTI Rating is the leading international standard for evaluating freedom of information laws, maintained by Access Info Europe and the Centre for Law and Democracy. It scores laws out of **150 total points** across seven categories:

1. **Right of Access** (6 points max)
2. **Scope** (30 points max)
3. **Requesting Procedures** (30 points max)
4. **Exceptions and Refusals** (30 points max)
5. **Appeals** (30 points max)
6. **Sanctions and Protections** (8 points max)
7. **Promotional Measures** (16 points max)

#### Top 10 Countries Worldwide

#### United States Federal FOIA

| Metric | Score | Global Rank |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Total Score** | 112/150 | #23 |
| **Right of Access** | 4/6 | Statutory, not constitutional |
| **Scope** | 24/30 | Federal agencies only |
| **Requesting Procedures** | 24/30 | Reasonable but fees problematic |
| **Exceptions and Refusals** | 20/30 | 9 exemptions, some overly broad |
| **Appeals** | 24/30 | Strong judicial review |

### 4.2 Why US Ranks #23 (Not #1)

**Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ Strong judicial review (courts can order disclosure)
- ‚úÖ Fewer exemptions than some countries (9 vs UK's 31)
- ‚úÖ Established case law provides guidance
- ‚úÖ Sanctions for non-compliance exist

**Weaknesses**:
- ‚ùå **No constitutional right** to information (statutory only)
- ‚ùå **No independent oversight body** (DOJ Office of Info Policy has no enforcement power)
- ‚ùå **Limited proactive disclosure** requirements
- ‚ùå **Fee barriers** (search and duplication costs can be prohibitive)
- ‚ùå **Response time abuse** (20-day standard routinely exceeded)
- ‚ùå **Broad national security exemptions** (post-9/11 expansion)

### 4.3 Comparative Analysis: Key Jurisdictions

#### Mexico üá≤üáΩ (World Leader - Tied #1)

**Legal Framework**: Federal Law on Transparency and Access to Public Information (2002, reformed 2015)

**Why Mexico Leads**:
1. **Constitutional Right**: Article 6 of Mexican Constitution guarantees right to information
2. **Autonomous Agency**: National Institute for Transparency, Access to Information and Personal Data Protection (INAI)
   - Independent of executive branch
   - Can order document release
   - Has enforcement powers
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
   - All federal entities
   - State governments (all 32 states have FOIA laws)
   - State-owned enterprises (PEMEX, CFE, etc.)
   - Labor unions
   - Political parties receiving public funding
4. **Proactive Disclosure**: Extensive mandatory publication requirements
5. **No Fees**: Digital requests are free
6. **Fast Response**: 20 days, extendable 20 more (strictly enforced)

**Comparison to US Federal FOIA**:
| Feature | Mexico | US Federal | Winner |
|---------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Constitutional basis | ‚úÖ Article 6 | ‚ùå Statutory only | üá≤üáΩ Mexico |
| Independent oversight | ‚úÖ INAI (autonomous) | ‚ùå DOJ (executive) | üá≤üáΩ Mexico |
| Fees | ‚úÖ Free for digital | ‚ùå Search + duplication | üá≤üáΩ Mexico |
| Response time | ‚ö†Ô∏è 20 days (enforced) | ‚ö†Ô∏è 20 days (routinely exceeded) | üá≤üáΩ Mexico |
| Coverage | ‚úÖ Includes SOEs, unions, parties | ‚ö†Ô∏è Federal agencies only | üá≤üáΩ Mexico |
| Proactive disclosure | ‚úÖ Extensive mandates | ‚ùå Minimal | üá≤üáΩ Mexico |
| Judicial review | ‚úÖ Available | ‚úÖ Available | ü§ù Tie |

**Key Lesson**: Independent oversight and constitutional status transform FOIA from paper right to practical reality.

#### Sweden üá∏üá™ (World Leader - Tied #1)

**Legal Framework**: Freedom of the Press Act 1766 (world's oldest FOIA law!)

**Why Sweden Leads**:
1. **259-Year Tradition**: Transparency as cultural norm since 1766
2. **Constitutional Status**: Part of Swedish Constitution (Fundamental Law)
3. **Presumption of Openness**: Default is disclosure; exceptions must be narrowly construed
4. **Minimal Fees**: Only actual copying costs
5. **Fast Response**: Immediate access to many records; formal requests quickly resolved
6. **Cultural Norm**: "Offentlighetsprincipen" (principle of public access) deeply embedded

**Comparison to US Federal FOIA**:
| Feature | Sweden | US Federal | Winner |
|---------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Legal history | ‚úÖ Since 1766 (259 years) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Since 1966 (59 years) | üá∏üá™ Sweden |
| Constitutional status | ‚úÖ Fundamental Law | ‚ùå Statutory | üá∏üá™ Sweden |
| Cultural norm | ‚úÖ Deep tradition | ‚ö†Ô∏è Variable acceptance | üá∏üá™ Sweden |
| Fees | ‚úÖ Copying only | ‚ùå Search + duplication | üá∏üá™ Sweden |
| Presumption | ‚úÖ Default disclosure | ‚ö†Ô∏è Agency discretion | üá∏üá™ Sweden |
| Speed | ‚úÖ Often immediate | ‚ùå Often delayed | üá∏üá™ Sweden |

**Key Lesson**: Long-term cultural commitment to transparency produces better outcomes than technical legal frameworks alone.

#### United Kingdom üá¨üáß (Ranks Lower Than US)

**Legal Framework**: Freedom of Information Act 2000

**RTI Rating**: 87/150 (US federal: 112/150)

**Why UK Ranks Lower**:
1. **More Exemptions**: 31 total exemptions (23 qualified + 8 absolute) vs US's 9
2. **Ministerial Veto**: Ministers can override Information Commissioner (rarely used but exists)
3. **Royal Prerogative**: Some Crown activities excluded
4. **Absolute Exemptions**: 8 exemptions not subject to public interest test

**Comparison to US Federal FOIA**:
| Feature | UK FOIA 2000 | US Federal FOIA | Winner |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| Number of exemptions | ‚ùå 31 | ‚úÖ 9 | üá∫üá∏ US |
| Ministerial override | ‚ùå Possible | ‚úÖ No | üá∫üá∏ US |
| Public interest test | ‚úÖ Required (qualified) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Implicit in courts | üá¨üáß UK |
| Independent regulator | ‚úÖ ICO | ‚ùå No (DOJ) | üá¨üáß UK |
| Proactive disclosure | ‚úÖ Publication schemes | ‚ùå Minimal | üá¨üáß UK |
| Response time | ‚ö†Ô∏è 20 working days | ‚ö†Ô∏è 20 business days | ü§ù Tie |

**Key Lesson**: More exemptions and ministerial veto significantly weaken transparency despite independent oversight.

#### European Union üá™üá∫ (Similar to US)

**Legal Framework**: Regulation 1049/2001 on Public Access to Documents

**RTI Rating**: 104/150 (US federal: 112/150)

**EU System Characteristics**:
1. **Constitutional Right**: Article 42, Charter of Fundamental Rights
2. **EU Institutions Only**: Does NOT cover member state governments (they have own laws)
3. **Multilingual**: Must accommodate 24 official EU languages
4. **Fast Response**: 15 working days (extendable 15 more)
5. **Member State Variation**: Sweden (136/150) to Poland (114/150)

**Comparison to US Federal FOIA**:
| Feature | EU Regulation 1049/2001 | US Federal FOIA | Winner |
|---------|------------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Constitutional basis | ‚úÖ Article 42 Charter | ‚ùå Statutory | üá™üá∫ EU |
| Response time | ‚úÖ 15 days | ‚ö†Ô∏è 20 days | üá™üá∫ EU |
| Multilingual | ‚úÖ 24 languages | ‚ö†Ô∏è English only | üá™üá∫ EU |
| Scope | ‚ö†Ô∏è EU institutions only | ‚ö†Ô∏è Federal agencies only | ü§ù Tie |
| Legislative exemption | ‚ùå Council in legislative role exempt | ‚ö†Ô∏è Congress exempt | üá∫üá∏ US (slightly) |
| Judicial review | ‚úÖ EU courts | ‚úÖ Federal courts | ü§ù Tie |

**Key Lesson**: Constitutional status and faster response times enhance EU system despite limited scope.

### 4.4 What US Can Learn from International Best Practices

**From Mexico**:
- ‚úÖ Establish independent transparency agency (like INAI) separate from executive branch
- ‚úÖ Elevate FOIA to constitutional status
- ‚úÖ Eliminate fees for digital requests
- ‚úÖ Mandate extensive proactive disclosure
- ‚úÖ Cover state-owned enterprises and public-private partnerships

**From Sweden**:
- ‚úÖ Foster cultural norm of openness (long-term educational effort)
- ‚úÖ Default to disclosure (narrow exemptions only)
- ‚úÖ Minimize fees (copying costs only)
- ‚úÖ Provide immediate access where possible (not all requests require 20-day wait)

**From UK**:
- ‚úÖ Establish independent Information Commissioner with enforcement power
- ‚úÖ Require publication schemes for proactive disclosure
- ‚úÖ Explicit public interest test for exemptions

**From EU**:
- ‚úÖ Constitutional-level right to information
- ‚úÖ Faster response times (15 vs 20 days)
- ‚úÖ Multilingual accommodation (relevant for US territories like Puerto Rico)

### 4.5 What Other Countries Can Learn from US

**Strong Judicial Review**:
- Federal courts actively enforce FOIA
- De novo review standard (courts review independently, not deferentially)
- Courts can order document release and hold officials in contempt

**Relatively Narrow Exemptions** (compared to UK):
- 9 core exemptions vs UK's 31
- Some exemptions have time limits (classified documents declassified over time)
- Case law has narrowed some exemptions (e.g., Exemption 5 attorney work product)

**Sanctions for Non-Compliance**:
- Attorneys' fees for successful FOIA litigation
- Discipline for arbitrary withholding
- Fee waivers for unreasonable delays

### 5.6 Validation Methodology Updates

**Additional Validation Steps for Territories (v0.12)**:

**7. Bilingual Verification** (for Puerto Rico):
- Obtain both Spanish and English statutory text from official sources
- Verify official translation accuracy (native Spanish speaker review)
- Document which language is legally authoritative
- Confirm requests can be submitted in both languages
- Verify responses provided in language of request

**8. Territorial Status Confirmation**:
- Verify organized vs. unorganized territory status
- Confirm citizenship status of residents (citizens vs. nationals)
- Document constitutional relationship to United States
- Note any unique governance structures

**9. Federal FOIA Interaction Analysis**:
- Document which agencies covered by federal FOIA
- Clarify boundaries between federal and territorial coverage
- Identify coverage gaps (territorial agencies not covered by federal FOIA)
- Note any conflicts or overlaps

**10. Transparency Gap Documentation** (for territories without confirmed FOIA):
- Confirm absence of comprehensive transparency statute
- Document alternative access mechanisms (common law, scattered provisions, etc.)
- Research common law access rights recognized by territorial courts
- Interview legal experts for practical guidance on records access
- Document democratic accountability implications

**11. Cultural Context Assessment** (especially American Samoa):
- Consult with cultural experts familiar with traditional governance
- Document traditional governance mechanisms and their impact on transparency
- Avoid imposing inappropriate Western legal frameworks
- Describe actual access practices (both formal and informal)
- Note any conflicts between traditional customs and Western transparency concepts

### 5.7 Script Updates Required

**Files Requiring Updates for v0.12**:

1. **`dev/scripts/smart-import.js`** (Supabase import):
   - Add territory slug mappings
   - Handle `data/territories/` directory structure
   - Process bilingual statutory text files (Spanish/English)
   - Import territory-specific fields (official_languages, citizenship_status, etc.)
   - Handle transparency_gap flag for CNMI and American Samoa

2. **`scripts/find_duplicates.py`**:
   - Check `data/territories/` directories
   - Handle bilingual file pairs (Spanish/English) without flagging as duplicates
   - Validate territory-specific schema fields

3. **`scripts/extract_map_data.py`**:
   - Include territories in output (Puerto Rico, Guam, USVI, CNMI, American Samoa)
   - Add territory-specific map coordinates (research needed)
   - Handle territories without FOIA (visual indicator on map - gray out or special marker)
   - Add territory type to map data

4. **`scripts/rename_to_v0_12.py`** (NEW - to be created):
   - Rename all `_template-v0.11` files to `_template-v0.12`
   - Update version strings in JSON metadata fields
   - Create `data/territories/` directory structure
   - Migrate any existing territory data to new structure

5. **`scripts/validate_territory_data.py`** (NEW - to be created):
   - Territory-specific validation logic
   - Bilingual file validation (verify both Spanish and English files exist for Puerto Rico)
   - FOIA existence verification (has_foia field matches actual statute documentation)
   - Cultural context completeness check (American Samoa)
   - Transparency gap documentation completeness

> **100% accuracy is mandatory** - this database serves as AI training ground truth. Only use **official government sources**:
> - Territory legislature websites (.gov.mp, .gov.gu, .gov.vi, .gov.pr, .gov.as)
> - Official territorial code databases
> - Official Attorney General offices (.gov domains only)
> - Official territorial courts (Supreme/Superior Court published opinions)
>
> **NEVER use**: Perplexity AI, Wikipedia, legal blogs, third-party summaries, AI-generated content, or any non-official sources.

**Application to Territory Research**:

‚úÖ **Acceptable Sources**:
- Territory legislature official websites (.gov.mp, .gov.gu, .gov.vi, etc.)
- Official territorial code databases (cnmilaw.org, lexjuris.com for PR)
- Territory Attorney General offices (.gov domains)
- Territory Supreme/Superior Court published opinions (official sites only)
- US Department of Interior (for territorial administration information)

- Legal blogs or commentary (even if written by lawyers)
- Third-party legal databases (Justia, FindLaw, LexisNexis) unless verified against official source
- MuckRock guides (useful starting point but must verify with official sources)
- News articles or media reports about transparency laws
- Academic papers (unless citing directly to official sources)

### 6.2 Territory Research Checklist

**For Each Territory with Confirmed FOIA Statute** (Puerto Rico, Guam, USVI):

**Phase 1: Statutory Text Acquisition** (Est. 5-8 hours per territory)
- [ ] Locate official code database for territory
- [ ] Obtain full official text of transparency statute
- [ ] Verify text is current (check for amendments since enactment)
- [ ] For bilingual jurisdictions (Puerto Rico): obtain both Spanish and English versions
- [ ] Confirm which language version is legally authoritative
- [ ] Save as `.txt` file following v0.12 naming convention
- [ ] Document source URL, access date, and verification method

**Phase 2: Implementing Regulations Research** (Est. 3-5 hours per territory)
- [ ] Research whether executive regulations exist supplementing statute
- [ ] Obtain full text of regulations from official administrative code
- [ ] Document fee schedules specified in regulations
- [ ] Identify designated FOIA officer/office from regulations
- [ ] Note any conflicts between statute and regulations
- [ ] Document regulatory citation and effective date

**Phase 3: Agency Mapping** (Est. 4-6 hours per territory)
- [ ] Create comprehensive list of all agencies subject to FOIA law
- [ ] Categorize agencies by branch (executive, legislative, judicial)
- [ ] For Puerto Rico: include municipal governments (78 municipalities)
- [ ] Identify FOIA contact person/office for each major agency
- [ ] Verify contact information current (test URLs and email addresses)
- [ ] Document any agency-specific procedures or exemptions

**Phase 4: Case Law Research** (Est. 3-5 hours per territory)
- [ ] Search territory Supreme Court/Superior Court for FOIA decisions
- [ ] Document key interpretive decisions (cite case name, citation, year)
- [ ] Note any judicial narrowing or broadening of statutory language
- [ ] Identify ongoing litigation affecting transparency rights
- [ ] Check for AG opinions interpreting transparency law

**Phase 5: Comparative Analysis** (Est. 2-3 hours per territory)
- [ ] Compare territory law to US federal FOIA (response time, fees, exemptions, appeals)
- [ ] Calculate estimated RTI Rating score (if sufficient information available)
- [ ] Document strengths relative to federal standard
- [ ] Document weaknesses relative to federal standard

### 7.2 Public Communication Strategy

#### Blog Post: "The Invisible Americans: Transparency Rights in US Territories"

**Target Publication**: theholetruth.org/blog/
**Publication Date**: Week 12 (concurrent with v0.12 release)
**Estimated Length**: 2,500-3,000 words
**Author Byline**: "The HOLE Foundation Research Team"

**Article Structure**:

**I. Introduction** (300 words)
- Hook: "5.4 million Americans live in US territories, but not all have the same right to access their government's records as residents of the 50 states."
- The discovery: How expanding our database to territories revealed a troubling two-tier system
- Why this matters: Transparency is the foundation of democratic accountability
- What we found: Some territories have strong FOIA laws, others may have none

**II. The Territory Transparency Problem** (400 words)
- Constitutional context: Territories are not states, different legal framework
- Federal FOIA limitation: Covers federal agencies only, not territorial governments
- The critical question: What happens when a territory lacks its own FOIA statute?
- Real-world implications: Journalists, researchers, citizens left without legal recourse
- Population affected: Potentially 200,000+ residents in CNMI and American Samoa

**III. Territory-by-Territory Findings** (800 words)

**Puerto Rico** (200 words)
- 3.2 million residents - larger than 21 US states
- Act 141-2019: Comprehensive transparency law enacted in 2019
- Bilingual jurisdiction: Requests accepted in Spanish and English
- Strengths: 10-day response time (faster than federal 20 days), proactive disclosure mandate
- Weaknesses: Enforcement criticized, no independent oversight body
- The irony: Territory residents have better transparency rights than some states

**Guam** (150 words)
- 171,000 residents
- Sunshine Reform Act of 1999: Combines FOIA with open meetings law
- Hybrid approach: Comprehensive government transparency in single statute
- Research needed: Full statutory analysis pending
- Island innovation: Integrated transparency framework

**US Virgin Islands** (150 words)
- 87,000 residents
- Public Records Act: Only 4 statutory sections (unusually brief)
- The challenge: Heavy reliance on regulations for operational details
- Potential gaps: Statutory brevity may leave procedural protections undefined
- Research priority: Understanding regulatory framework essential

**Northern Mariana Islands** (150 words)
- 47,000 US citizens
- **CRITICAL FINDING**: No comprehensive FOIA statute identified
- The transparency gap: Residents may lack any statutory right to access local government records
- Constitutional silence: Privacy protections exist, but no affirmative transparency right
- Call for research: Comprehensive code search urgently needed

**American Samoa** (150 words)
- 49,000 US nationals (not citizens)
- **CRITICAL FINDING**: No FOIA statute identified
- Cultural context: Traditional fa'a Samoa governance may affect Western transparency concepts
- The challenge: Limited online legal resources, geographic isolation
- Respectful approach: Avoiding inappropriate imposition of Western frameworks
- Research requirements: Cultural competency essential

**IV. International Comparison** (500 words)
- The surprise: US ranks only #23 globally for transparency (112/150 points)
- World leaders: Mexico and Sweden (136/150 each)
- What Mexico does better: Constitutional right, independent oversight (INAI), no fees
- What Sweden does better: 259-year tradition, cultural norm of openness, presumption of disclosure
- UK ranks lower than US: 31 exemptions vs. US's 9, ministerial veto
- Key lesson: Independent oversight transforms FOIA from paper right to practical reality
- Territory implications: Some territories may have weaker laws than US federal standard

**V. The Two-Tier System Explained** (300 words)
- Tier 1 (Federal FOIA): Works for federal agency records in territories
- Tier 2 (Territorial FOIA): Only works if territory has enacted own statute
- The gray zone: When no statute exists, agencies have complete discretion
- Common law inadequate: No appeal, no enforcement, no accountability
- Comparison table: Statutory FOIA vs. Common Law Access
- The democratic deficit: Residents cannot investigate corruption, verify spending, monitor government

**VI. What This Means for Territory Residents** (300 words)
- For journalists: Cannot compel document production for investigations
- For researchers: Cannot access public health, education, environmental data
- For citizens: Cannot verify how tax dollars are spent
- For whistleblowers: Lack legal protection for disclosing wrongdoing
- For courts: No basis to order document release
- Real-world scenarios: Examples of transparency denials in jurisdictions without FOIA

1. THREAD: We just expanded our US Transparency Laws Database to include territories‚Äîand discovered a troubling two-tier system affecting 5.4 million Americans. Here's what we found: üßµ
2. First, context: US territories are NOT states. Federal FOIA covers federal agencies only‚Äînot territorial governments. So territorial residents need their own local FOIA laws to access local government records.
3. PUERTO RICO ‚úÖ: 3.2M residents (bigger than 21 states!) have Act 141-2019. Requests accepted in Spanish & English. 10-day response time‚Äîfaster than federal 20 days. Strong proactive disclosure. But enforcement weak, no independent oversight.
4. GUAM ‚úÖ: 171K residents protected by Sunshine Reform Act of 1999. Innovative hybrid statute combining FOIA + open meetings law. Full analysis pending, but statute exists and is enforced.
5. US VIRGIN ISLANDS ‚úÖ: 87K residents have Public Records Act... but it's only 4 sections long (!). Likely heavy reliance on regulations for details. Requires further research to understand practical access.
6. NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS ‚ùå: 47K US citizens. We could NOT find a comprehensive FOIA statute. Constitutional privacy protection exists, but no affirmative transparency right. Potential transparency crisis.
7. AMERICAN SAMOA ‚ùå: 49K US nationals. No FOIA statute identified. Traditional fa'a Samoa governance adds cultural complexity. Limited online legal resources. Most challenging research case‚Äîrequires cultural expert consultation.
8. The implications are stark. In territories without FOIA: ‚ùå No right to access records ‚ùå No appeal mechanism ‚ùå No judicial enforcement ‚ùå Agencies have complete discretion ‚ùå Democratic accountability fundamentally weakened
9. Real-world impact: Journalists can't compel documents. Researchers can't access health/education data. Citizens can't verify spending. Whistleblowers lack protection. Courts can't order disclosure.
10. International context: US ranks #23 globally for transparency (112/150). Mexico & Sweden lead at 136/150 with constitutional rights, independent oversight, no fees. Some US territories may rank even lower than US federal.
11. Common law access is NOT enough. No statutory right = no appeal, no enforcement, no accountability. Agencies decide what's "public" with zero oversight. Access depends on personal relationships, not legal rights.
12. What's needed: ‚úÖ Territory legislatures enact comprehensive FOIA laws ‚úÖ Congress extends baseline transparency rights ‚úÖ Independent oversight bodies (like Mexico's INAI) ‚úÖ Proactive disclosure mandates ‚úÖ Minimal/no fees
13. Our v0.12 database now covers 56 jurisdictions: 50 states + DC + Federal + 5 territories. First comprehensive territorial transparency database. Open source, free, powers @theholetruth map/wiki/FOIA generator.
14. Research continues on CNMI & American Samoa. We need definitive answers: Do comprehensive statutes exist? What are practical access procedures? What cultural considerations apply?

## Part VIII: Conclusion and Next Steps

### 8.1 Summary of Findings

This research memorandum documents the expansion of the US Transparency Laws Database from 51 jurisdictions (50 states + DC + Federal) to 56 jurisdictions by adding coverage of the 5 inhabited US territories: Puerto Rico, Guam, US Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.

**Key Findings**:

**Confirmed Transparency Laws** (3 territories):
- **Puerto Rico**: Act 141-2019 provides comprehensive transparency rights to 3.2 million residents, with 10-day response time and bilingual (Spanish/English) access. Stronger than federal FOIA in some respects, but lacks independent oversight.
- **Guam**: Sunshine Reform Act of 1999 protects 171,000 residents through innovative hybrid FOIA/open meetings statute. Full statutory analysis pending.
- **US Virgin Islands**: Public Records Act covers 87,000 residents, but statute is unusually brief (4 sections). Heavy reliance on regulations; potential procedural gaps require research.

**Unconfirmed/Absent Transparency Laws** (2 territories):
- **Northern Mariana Islands**: No comprehensive FOIA statute identified for 47,000 US citizens. Represents potential transparency crisis requiring urgent research.
- **American Samoa**: No FOIA statute identified for 49,000 US nationals. Traditional fa'a Samoa governance adds cultural complexity. Requires specialized cultural competency research.

**Two-Tier Transparency System**:
- Federal FOIA covers federal agencies operating in territories but does NOT cover territorial governments
- Territorial residents depend entirely on local FOIA statutes for access to local government records
- Territories without FOIA statutes leave residents with no guaranteed access rights, no appeals, and no judicial enforcement
- Common law access is inadequate substitute for comprehensive statutory protection

**International Context**:
- US ranks #23 globally for transparency (112/150 RTI Rating points)
- Mexico and Sweden lead at 136/150 with constitutional rights, independent oversight, and minimal fees
- Some US territories may have weaker transparency frameworks than the already-modest US federal standard
- International best practices (independent oversight, constitutional status, proactive disclosure) should inform territorial reform

### 8.2 Research Gaps and Limitations

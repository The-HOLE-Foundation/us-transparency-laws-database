# COMPREHENSIVE STATUTE VALIDATION PLAN-v0.10->v0.11 Project

## üéØ **MISSION CRITICAL: VALIDATE ALL 51 JURISDICTIONS**

**Purpose**: Ensure 100% accuracy of transparency statutes before any obstruction analysis or tool development.

## üîç **VALIDATION METHODOLOGY**

### **Tier 1 Priority: High-Impact States** (Week 1-2)
**Critical for immediate validation due to size/complexity**

1. **New York** - URGENT: S2520A status verification
2. **California** - Post-recodification citation verification
3. **Texas** - Biennial legislature session updates
4. **Florida** - Broad exemption landscape changes
5. **Illinois** - SB1445 (2023) amendment integration
6. **Pennsylvania** - Website access issues resolution
7. **Ohio** - Recent amendment verification
8. **Georgia** - Source availability confirmation

### **Tier 2 Priority: Medium States** (Week 2-3)
**Important jurisdictions with recent activity**

9. **Michigan** - Verified but needs recent check
10. **Virginia** - Confirmed current but double-check
11. **Washington** - Fee structure updates verification
12. **North Carolina** - Recent legislative activity
13. **New Jersey** - Commercial vs non-commercial changes
14. **Arizona** - Pending 5-day response requirement
15. **Massachusetts** - Municipal vs state timeline differences
16. **Tennessee** - OORC oversight changes

### **Tier 3 Priority: Remaining States** (Week 3-4)
**Standard verification for remaining 35 jurisdictions**

All other states plus DC - systematic verification using established methodology.

## üìã **VALIDATION CHECKLIST FOR EACH JURISDICTION**

### **Step 1: Current Statute Verification**
- [ ] Download statute from official .gov source
- [ ] Verify citation accuracy and current numbering
- [ ] Confirm effective date and version
- [ ] Document official source URL
- [ ] Save full statutory text locally

### **Step 2: Amendment History Check**

- [ ] Check bill tracking systems for pending changes
- [ ] Verify effective dates of any recent changes
- [ ] Document amendment impact on response times/fees/procedures
- [ ] Note any pending legislation (like NY S2520A)

### **Step 3: Cross-Reference Validation**
- [ ] Confirm with multiple official sources (attorney general, secretary of state)
- [ ] Check judicial interpretations and recent cases
- [ ] Verify against state transparency officer guidance
- [ ] Compare with legal database versions (as secondary check only)

### **Step 4: Downstream Data Validation**
- [ ] Update response time requirements
- [ ] Correct fee structures and limitations
- [ ] Verify exemption categories and citations
- [ ] Update enforcement mechanisms and appeal processes
- [ ] Correct any affected metadata in our database

### **Step 5: Documentation and Quality Control**

# Version 0.12 Roadmap

## Overview

Version 0.12 will complete **Layer 2 (Structured Jurisdiction Data)** - the missing piece needed for full platform functionality.

**Status**: Deferred from v0.11 (icing on the cake)
**Priority**: Medium (nice-to-have, not blocking platform launch)
**Timeline**: Q1-Q2 2026

---

## v0.11 Baseline: Basic FOIA Generator

**What's Included in v0.11**:
- Azure AI Foundry agent with GPT-4o-mini/nano
- Vector database containing transparency law dataset
- Basic FOIA request generation (no custom training)
- Generic templates (no jurisdiction-specific optimization)

**Limitations**:
- Cannot address specific agencies (no contact database)
- Generic output (no custom examples or training)
- Limited success optimization

**Goal**: Get system up and running, introduce complexities in v0.12+

---

## Deferred Features from v0.11

### 1. Agency Contact Databases (Layer 2)
**Status**: Postponed to v0.12+
**Impact**: FOIA Generator cannot address specific agencies
**Scope**: ~5,000 agency records across 51 jurisdictions

**What's Needed**:
```json
{
  "agencies": [
    {
      "name": "Maine Department of Education",
      "foia_email": "foia@maine.gov",
      "foia_address": {
        "street": "23 State House Station",
        "city": "Augusta",
        "state": "ME",
        "zip": "04333"
      },
      "phone": "(207) 624-6600",
      "fax": "(207) 624-6700",
      "website": "https://www.maine.gov/doe/",
      "foia_officer": "Jane Smith",
      "notes": "Use email for fastest response"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Per Jurisdiction**: 50-200 agencies
**Total Dataset**: ~5,000 agency records

**Research Requirements** (per state):
- Identify all agencies with FOIA obligations (20-40 hours)
- Verify current contact information (10-20 hours)
- Test email addresses and phone numbers (5-10 hours)
- Document special submission requirements (5-10 hours)

**Workload Estimate**: 40-80 hours per jurisdiction × 51 = 2,040-4,080 hours total

## Alternative: Phased Release Strategy

### Option A: Release v0.12 Incrementally
- v0.12-alpha: Federal + 5 priority states (Month 2)
- v0.12-beta: 21 total jurisdictions (Month 4)
- v0.12-stable: All 51 jurisdictions (Month 10)

**Pros**: Earlier user feedback, revenue generation, iterative improvement
**Cons**: Multiple deployment cycles, user confusion about coverage

### Option B: Wait for Complete v0.12
- v0.12-stable: All 51 jurisdictions at once (Month 10)

**Pros**: Single comprehensive release, consistent user experience
**Cons**: Delayed value delivery, no early feedback loop

**Recommendation**: **Option A** - Progressive delivery aligns with modern SaaS best practices

## Dependencies and Blockers

### Prerequisite: v0.11 Platform Launch
- Supabase schema must support Layer 2 structure
- Frontend must handle "data pending" states gracefully
- Feature flags must be in place for progressive enablement

### External Dependencies
- Access to official state agency directories
- Email verification services (for contact validation)
- Legal review for template language (optional but recommended)

### Resource Requirements
- 1-2 researchers for data collection
- 1 developer for automation scripts
- 1 legal advisor for template review (part-time)
- AI assistant time (GPT-4 API costs)

---

## Cost Estimates

### Labor Costs (Conservative)
- Researchers: 3,519 hours × $25/hr = **$87,975**
- Developer (automation): 500 hours × $75/hr = **$37,500**
- Legal review: 200 hours × $150/hr = **$30,000**
- **Total**: **$155,475**

### AI/Automation Costs
- GPT-4 API: ~$5,000-10,000 (parsing + template generation)
- Web scraping infrastructure: ~$1,000-2,000

### Total v0.12 Budget
- **Low estimate**: $163,475
- **High estimate**: $210,000 (with contingency)

---

## Notes from Team

**Decision**: Agencies postponed to v0.12+ (icing on cake)
**Rationale**: Platform can launch with v0.11-foundation (Layer 1 + Layer 3)
**Timeline**: v0.12 development begins after v0.11 platform launch
**Next Steps**: Focus on Figma design + Supabase backend integration

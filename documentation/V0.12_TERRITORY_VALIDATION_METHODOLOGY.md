# Territory Validation Methodology (v0.12)

## Purpose

This document defines the validation methodology specific to US territories for the v0.12 database expansion. It supplements the general VALIDATION_METHODOLOGY.md with territory-specific requirements, cultural competency standards, and transparency gap documentation protocols.

**Critical**: Territories require specialized validation procedures due to:
- Bilingual jurisdictions (Puerto Rico)
- Traditional governance systems (American Samoa fa'a Samoa)
- Potential absence of FOIA statutes (transparency gaps)
- Limited online legal resources
- Different constitutional status from US states

## Transparency Gap Validation (CNMI, American Samoa)

### Purpose

If comprehensive FOIA statute cannot be located, database must document **transparency gap** - the absence of guaranteed statutory access rights for territorial residents.

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Code Search

**Objective**: Systematically search entire territorial code to confirm absence of FOIA

**Steps**:
1. **Search online code database**
   - CNMI: https://cnmilaw.org/
   - American Samoa: Attempt online access or request physical code

2. **Search for key terms**
   - "public records"
   - "freedom of information"
   - "access to information"
   - "transparency"
   - "right to know"
   - "open government"
   - "sunshine"

3. **Search related statutes**
   - Administrative Procedures Act (APA)
   - Open Meetings Act / Sunshine Law
   - Archives and Records Management Law
   - Government Ethics Law

4. **Document search methodology**
   - Databases searched
   - Search terms used
   - Date of search
   - Results (negative results documented)

5. **Create negative search certificate**
   ```
   NEGATIVE SEARCH CERTIFICATE

   Date: 2025-10-07
   Researcher: [Name]
   Jurisdiction: Northern Mariana Islands

   I certify that I have conducted a systematic search of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Code (cnmilaw.org) using the following search terms: [list terms]. No comprehensive freedom of information or public records statute was identified.

   Scattered provisions related to public records access may exist in specific titles (e.g., APA, open meetings law) but no general right to access government records comparable to state or federal FOIA statutes was found.

   This search was conducted on [date] and reflects the code as of that date. Future legislative action may enact transparency statutes not captured by this search.

   Signed: [Researcher]
   ```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Entire territorial code systematically searched
- [ ] All search terms documented
- [ ] Negative results documented
- [ ] Scattered provisions noted (if any)
- [ ] Negative search certificate completed

### Phase 2: Official Inquiry to Attorney General

**Objective**: Obtain official guidance on records access laws from territorial AG

**Steps**:
1. **Draft formal inquiry letter**
   ```
   [Date]

   Office of the Attorney General
   [Territory Name]
   [Address]

   Re: Freedom of Information / Public Records Access Laws

   Dear Attorney General:

   The HOLE Foundation is conducting research on transparency laws across all US jurisdictions for our US Transparency Laws Database (https://github.com/The-HOLE-Foundation/us-transparency-laws-database).

   We are seeking official guidance on the following questions:

   1. Does [Territory] have a comprehensive freedom of information act or public records law granting residents the right to access government records?

   2. If yes, please provide:
      - Statutory citation (title, chapter, section numbers)
      - Name of statute (if any)
      - Effective date
      - Any implementing regulations

   3. If no comprehensive statute exists, what legal mechanisms (if any) allow residents to access government records?
      - Common law access rights?
      - Scattered statutory provisions?
      - Administrative procedures act provisions?

   4. Could you direct us to official resources where we can obtain the authoritative text of any relevant statutes or regulations?

   This research will be published open-source to serve transparency advocates, journalists, and residents. Accurate information from your office would be greatly appreciated.

   Thank you for your assistance.

   Sincerely,
   [Researcher Name]
   The HOLE Foundation
   research@theholefoundation.org

### Phase 3: Common Law Research

**Objective**: Determine if territorial courts recognize common law access rights

**Steps**:
1. **Search territorial Supreme Court decisions**
   - Cases involving public access to government records
   - Cases citing common law right to inspect
   - Cases interpreting open meetings laws (may address records)

2. **Search federal district court decisions**
   - Federal cases interpreting territorial law
   - Cases establishing or rejecting common law access

3. **Document findings**
   - If common law access recognized: cite cases, describe scope
   - If common law access rejected: cite cases, explain rationale
   - If no case law found: document negative search

4. **Compare to statutory access**
   - Common law access much weaker (no appeal, no enforcement)
   - Narrow scope (typically financial records only)
   - Court reluctance to order disclosure

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Territorial court database searched
- [ ] Federal district court cases reviewed
- [ ] Common law status documented (recognized/rejected/unclear)
- [ ] Scope and limitations documented (if recognized)
- [ ] Comparison to statutory access explained

### Phase 4: Federal FOIA Coverage Analysis

**Objective**: Clarify what records ARE accessible via federal FOIA vs. what are NOT

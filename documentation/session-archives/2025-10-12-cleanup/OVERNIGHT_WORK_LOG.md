## Methodology

### Data Collection Approach

**For Record Exclusions**:
1. Read statute full text
2. Search for explicit exclusions ("shall not be public", "not subject to disclosure")
3. Extract statutory cite
4. Categorize by record type
5. Note if absolute or conditional
6. Import to Neon

**For Court Rules**:
1. Check if statute mentions court records
2. Research state court rules
3. Document differences from general FOIA
4. Note access procedures
5. Import to Neon

**For Case Law**:
1. Search official court databases
2. Find leading transparency law cases
3. Extract holding and significance
4. Link to relevant rights/exemptions
5. Verify still good law
6. Import to Neon

## Quality Standards

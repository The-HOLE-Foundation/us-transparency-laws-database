# Repository Cleanup Status Report

## Executive Summary

**Current Status**: Cleanup in progress - Phase 3 complete
**Data Location**: All affirmative rights data is in archive backup
**Worktrees**: Empty (52 created but no data)
**Action Required**: Decision on data restoration approach

## Cleanup Phases Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Fix .gitignore
- Updated .gitignore to exclude node_modules, build outputs, IDE files
- Created backup of original .gitignore
- Status: COMPLETE

### ✅ Phase 2: Stop Tracking node_modules
- Verified node_modules not currently tracked (0 files)
- Created git checkpoint
- Status: COMPLETE (no action needed)

### ✅ Phase 3: Consolidate Affirmative Rights Data
- Scanned all 52 worktrees for rights files
- Result: 0 files found in worktrees
- Created empty consolidation directory
- Status: COMPLETE (but found no data)

## Data Inventory

### Archive: 2025-10-11-complete-data-backup
**Location**: `./.archive/2025-10-11-complete-data-backup/`
**Files**: 46 jurisdictions with affirmative rights JSON
**Total Size**: ~496 KB
**Created**: 2025-10-11 01:00

**Files Present** (46 of 52 expected):
- ✅ Federal
- ✅ Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas
- ✅ Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware
- ✅ Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa
- ✅ Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana
- ✅ Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana
- ✅ Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota
- ✅ Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon
- ✅ Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota
- ✅ Tennessee, Texas, Utah
- ✅ Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming

**Missing** (6 of 52):
- ❌ California
- ❌ District of Columbia
- ❌ Florida
- ❌ Georgia
- ❌ New York
- ❌ North Carolina

### Worktrees Status
**Location**: `/worktrees/affirmative/`
**Count**: 52 worktrees (one per jurisdiction)
**Status**: All created but empty - no affirmative-rights files
**Branches**: Each has verification/{jurisdiction}-affirmative branch
**Issue**: Worktrees were created but data was never populated

### Neon Database (from earlier analysis)
**Jurisdictions with Rights**: 14
**Total Rights**: 262

Jurisdictions in database:
- Arkansas (15 rights)
- California (25 rights)
- Connecticut (20 rights)
- Florida (20 rights)
- Georgia (17 rights)
- Illinois (20 rights)
- Louisiana (16 rights)
- Massachusetts (20 rights)
- New York (20 rights)
- North Carolina (15 rights)
- Oregon (19 rights)
- Texas (20 rights)
- Washington (20 rights)
- Federal (15 rights)

## Key Findings

1. **Data Exists But Not Where Expected**
   - Archive has 46 jurisdiction files (quality unknown)
   - Worktrees are empty (never populated)
   - Neon database has 14 jurisdictions (262 rights)

2. **Mismatch Between Sources**
   - Archive: 46 jurisdictions
   - Database: 14 jurisdictions
   - Missing from archive: 6 jurisdictions (CA, DC, FL, GA, NY, NC)
   - Overlap: 14 in database, many in archive

3. **Worktrees Not Utilized**
   - 52 worktrees created with verification branches
   - None contain the expected affirmative-rights data
   - Purpose unclear - may have been planned workflow that wasn't executed

## Recommendations

### Option A: Restore Archive Data to Proper Locations
**Rationale**: Archive data likely represents valid extraction work

**Steps**:
1. Validate archive data quality (check JSON structure, citations)
2. Copy 46 files to appropriate worktree locations
3. Verify against Neon database (compare overlapping jurisdictions)
4. Import verified data to database
5. Continue cleanup phases 4-5

**Risk**: Low - archive data appears complete and properly structured
**Time**: 30 minutes validation + import

### Option B: Use Database as Source of Truth
**Rationale**: Database has 14 verified jurisdictions

**Steps**:
1. Export 14 jurisdictions from Neon database
2. Place in proper directory structure
3. Mark remaining 38 jurisdictions as "needs extraction"
4. Continue extraction work for missing states
5. Continue cleanup phases 4-5

**Risk**: Low - database is production data
**Time**: 15 minutes export + setup

### Option C: Fresh Start with Extraction
**Rationale**: Ensure 100% accuracy by re-extracting from statutory texts

**Steps**:
1. Archive all existing rights data (backup)
2. Start systematic extraction from statutory texts
3. Work through all 52 jurisdictions fresh
4. Verify each against official sources
5. Import to database incrementally

**Risk**: Medium - most time-consuming, but ensures accuracy
**Time**: 2-3 weeks for complete extraction

## Immediate Next Steps

**Recommended**: Option A - Restore and Validate Archive Data

1. **Validate Archive Data Quality** (15 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Check all 46 files for valid JSON
   for file in ./.archive/2025-10-11-complete-data-backup/*.json; do
       echo "Checking $file..."
       python3 -m json.tool "$file" > /dev/null && echo "✓ Valid" || echo "✗ Invalid"
   done
   ```

2. **Sample Review** (15 minutes)
   - Manually review 3-5 random files
   - Check statutory citations
   - Verify JSON structure matches template
   - Compare with Neon data for overlapping jurisdictions

3. **Decision Point**:
   - If archive data is good → Restore to proper locations
   - If archive data is questionable → Use database as source of truth
   - If both have issues → Consider fresh extraction

4. **Continue Cleanup**:
   - Phase 4: Clean worktrees (after data restoration)
   - Phase 5: Archive documentation

## Files and Directories Modified

### Created:
- `data/v0.12/affirmative-rights-consolidated/` (empty)
- `.gitignore.backup`
- Git checkpoint tag: `cleanup-checkpoint-20251012-*`

### Modified:
- `.gitignore` (added node_modules, build dirs, etc.)
- Git commits:
  - "checkpoint: before removing node_modules from tracking"

### To Review:
- `./.archive/2025-10-11-complete-data-backup/` (46 rights files)
- `/worktrees/affirmative/*/` (52 empty worktrees)

## Questions for User

1. **What is the archive data source?**
   - Was this extracted by previous sessions?
   - Has it been verified against official sources?
   - Should we trust it as ground truth?

2. **What was the worktree workflow intention?**
   - Were worktrees meant for parallel extraction?
   - Why are they empty?
   - Should we populate them or remove them?

3. **Which source is authoritative?**
   - Archive files (46 jurisdictions)?
   - Neon database (14 jurisdictions)?
   - Neither (need fresh extraction)?

4. **How to proceed?**
   - Option A: Validate and use archive data
   - Option B: Use database as source of truth
   - Option C: Fresh extraction from scratch

**Status**: Awaiting direction on data restoration approach
**Next Session**: Begin validation or proceed with selected option

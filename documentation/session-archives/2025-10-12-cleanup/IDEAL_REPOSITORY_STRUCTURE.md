# IDEAL REPOSITORY STRUCTURE - Ground-Up Design

## Core Principle: ONE FILE, ONE LOCATION

**Golden Rule**: Every file lives in exactly ONE place. No duplicates, no copies, no confusion.

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Jurisdiction-Centric Organization

**Why**: Each jurisdiction is a self-contained unit
**How**: `data/jurisdictions/{level}/{state}/` contains ALL data for that state
**Benefit**: Want California data? Go to `data/jurisdictions/states/california/` - everything is there

### 2. Single Source of Truth

**Rule**: Original data lives in `data/jurisdictions/`
**Rule**: Consolidated files are GENERATED, never edited manually
**Rule**: Database is populated FROM `data/jurisdictions/`, not the other way around

**Data Flow**:
```
Official .gov Statute
    ↓
data/jurisdictions/california/statute-full-text.txt (TRUTH)
    ↓
Extract rights/exemptions
    ↓
data/jurisdictions/california/rights.json (TRUTH)
    ↓
Generate consolidated (READ-ONLY)
    ↓
data/consolidated/all-rights.json (GENERATED)
    ↓
Import to Neon
    ↓
rights_of_access table (DATABASE COPY)
```

### 3. No Worktrees Needed!

**Current Problem**: Worktrees for parallel work
**Better Solution**: Just use branches + clear file structure

**Why Worktrees Aren't Needed**:
- Each jurisdiction has its own folder already
- Multiple people can work on different states simultaneously
- Just edit `data/jurisdictions/states/alabama/rights.json` directly
- Commit when done
- No complex worktree setup needed

**If You MUST Use Worktrees**:
```
worktrees/alabama/
└── .git                               # ONLY git metadata
    # Checkout points to: data/jurisdictions/states/alabama/
    # That's it. Nothing else.
```

### 4. Clear File Naming

**Pattern**: `{purpose}.{format}`
- `metadata.json` (not `alabama-metadata.json` - folder name tells you it's Alabama)
- `rights.json` (not `affirmative-rights.json` - we know they're rights)
- `statute-full-text.txt` (descriptive, clear)

### 5. Generated vs Source Files

**Source Files** (edit these):
- `data/jurisdictions/states/california/rights.json`
- `data/jurisdictions/states/texas/exemptions.json`

**Generated Files** (NEVER edit these):
- `data/consolidated/all-rights.json`
- `data/consolidated/all-exemptions.json`

Mark generated files clearly:
```json
{
  "_generated": true,
  "_source": "data/jurisdictions/*/rights.json",
  "_generated_at": "2025-10-11T00:00:00Z",
  "_do_not_edit": "This file is auto-generated. Edit source files instead."
}
```

## Comparison: Current vs Ideal

### Current Structure (Confusing)

```
data/
├── v0.12/
│   ├── affirmative-rights/           # Some files here?
│   │   └── texas-UNVERIFIED.json
│   ├── rights/                        # Or here?
│   │   └── federal-rights.json
│   └── affirmative-rights-consolidated/  # Or here??
│
worktrees/affirmative/alabama/
├── data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/    # Or here???
│   └── alabama-rights.json
├── data/v0.12/rights/                 # Old files here too????
│   ├── federal-rights.json (duplicate!)
│   └── (8 other duplicates)
├── node_modules/ (89 MB duplicate!)
├── CLAUDE.md (duplicate!)
└── (entire repo duplicated)

# WHERE IS THE TRUTH? Nobody knows!
```

### Ideal Structure (Clear)

```
data/jurisdictions/
├── federal/
│   ├── metadata.json                 # TRUTH lives here
│   ├── statute-full-text.txt         # TRUTH lives here
│   ├── exemptions.json               # TRUTH lives here
│   └── rights.json                   # TRUTH lives here
│
├── states/
│   ├── alabama/
│   │   ├── metadata.json             # TRUTH lives here (Alabama only)
│   │   ├── statute-full-text.txt     # TRUTH lives here (Alabama only)
│   │   ├── exemptions.json           # TRUTH lives here (Alabama only)
│   │   └── rights.json               # TRUTH lives here (Alabama only)
│   │
│   ├── california/
│   │   └── (same 4 files)
│   │
│   └── ... (all 50 states + DC)
│
└── consolidated/                      # GENERATED (read-only)
    ├── all-rights.json               # Auto-generated from all jurisdictions
    ├── all-exemptions.json           # Auto-generated from all jurisdictions
    └── _DO_NOT_EDIT.md               # Warning: files are generated

# TRUTH IS CLEAR: data/jurisdictions/{state}/rights.json
# NO DUPLICATES. NO CONFUSION.
```

## Migration Path: Current → Ideal

### Phase 1: Collect All Unique Data (SAFE - No Deletion)

```bash
# Create ideal structure
mkdir -p data/jurisdictions/federal
mkdir -p data/jurisdictions/states/{alabama,alaska,...all 50 states}
mkdir -p data/jurisdictions/states/district-of-columbia

# For each jurisdiction:
# 1. Find its unique rights file (might be in worktree or main repo)
# 2. Copy to data/jurisdictions/states/{state}/rights.json
# 3. Find its statute text
# 4. Copy to data/jurisdictions/states/{state}/statute-full-text.txt
# 5. Find its metadata
# 6. Copy to data/jurisdictions/states/{state}/metadata.json
```

### Phase 2: Verify Nothing Was Lost

```bash
# Compare:
# - Old locations (worktrees, v0.12 folders)
# - New locations (data/jurisdictions)
# - Neon database

# Ensure all data accounted for
```

### Phase 3: Update All Scripts to Use New Locations

```bash
# Update import scripts:
# OLD: reads from data/v0.12/rights/
# NEW: reads from data/jurisdictions/states/*/rights.json

# Update export scripts:
# OLD: writes to data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/
# NEW: writes to data/jurisdictions/states/*/rights.json
```

### Phase 4: Delete Old Structures (ONLY After Verification)

```bash
# Move to archive
mv data/v0.12 .archive/2025-10-11-old-v0.12-structure/

# Clean worktrees
rm -rf worktrees/  # Or keep them minimal if still useful
```

## Specific File Mapping

### Where Each File Type Should Live

| File Type | Current Location(s) | Ideal Location | Count |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| **Rights JSON** | `data/v0.12/rights/`, `data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/`, `worktrees/*/data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/` | `data/jurisdictions/{level}/{state}/rights.json` | 52 files |
| **Statute Text** | `consolidated-transparency-data/statutory-text-files/` | `data/jurisdictions/{level}/{state}/statute-full-text.txt` | 52 files |
| **Metadata** | `releases/v0.11.0/jurisdictions/` | `data/jurisdictions/{level}/{state}/metadata.json` | 52 files |
| **Exemptions** | In metadata.json | `data/jurisdictions/{level}/{state}/exemptions.json` | 52 files |
| **Migrations** | `supabase/migrations/` | `database/migrations/` | ~10 files |
| **Schemas** | `schemas/` (scattered) | `database/schemas/` | ~5 files |
| **Import Scripts** | `dev/scripts/`, `Transparency-Map-Dataset/` | `database/scripts/` | ~5 files |
| **Documentation** | Root, `documentation/`, `.claude/`, everywhere | `docs/` (user) + `documentation/` (technical) | ~30 files |
| **Session Docs** | Root, everywhere | `.archive/YYYY-MM-DD/` | 0 (archived) |

### What Goes Away Entirely

| Item | Current | Ideal | Why |
|------|---------|-------|-----|
| **Worktrees** | 52 worktrees × 89 MB | 0 or minimal | Not needed with clear structure |
| **v0.12 folder maze** | `data/v0.12/rights/`, `data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/`, etc. | Gone | Replaced by `data/jurisdictions/` |
| **Duplicate statutory text** | Multiple copies | ONE per jurisdiction | Consolidation |
| **node_modules in git** | 5,212 files tracked | 0 files tracked | Proper .gitignore |
| **Duplicate docs** | 16,460+ | 30 unique | Archive old, one copy of active |

## The Answer to Your Question

**"Is it possible to make it look like that without messing anything up?"**

**YES** - Here's how:

### Safe Migration Strategy

**Step 1: Create Ideal Structure (Parallel)**
```bash
# Build new structure alongside old one
# Don't delete anything yet
mkdir -p data/jurisdictions/{federal,states,territories}
```

**Step 2: Populate Ideal Structure (COPY, Don't Move)**
```bash
# For each jurisdiction:
# 1. Find rights file (wherever it is)
# 2. COPY to data/jurisdictions/states/{state}/rights.json
# 3. Find statute text
# 4. COPY to data/jurisdictions/states/{state}/statute-full-text.txt
# 5. Find metadata
# 6. COPY to data/jurisdictions/states/{state}/metadata.json
```

**Step 3: Verify Completeness**
```bash
# Check that every jurisdiction has all files:
for state in data/jurisdictions/states/*/; do
    echo "Checking $(basename $state)..."
    [ -f "$state/metadata.json" ] && echo "  ✓ metadata" || echo "  ✗ metadata MISSING"
    [ -f "$state/rights.json" ] && echo "  ✓ rights" || echo "  ✗ rights MISSING"
    [ -f "$state/statute-full-text.txt" ] && echo "  ✓ statute" || echo "  ✗ statute MISSING"
    [ -f "$state/exemptions.json" ] && echo "  ✓ exemptions" || echo "  ✗ exemptions MISSING"
done
```

**Step 4: Verify Against Neon Database**
```bash
# Ensure Neon database matches new structure
# If discrepancies found, investigate before proceeding
```

**Step 5: Update Scripts to Use New Locations**
```bash
# Change all import scripts to read from data/jurisdictions/
# Test each script
# Verify they work with new structure
```

**Step 6: ONLY After Full Verification - Archive Old Structure**
```bash
# Move old structure to archive (don't delete)
mkdir -p .archive/2025-10-11-migration-to-ideal-structure
mv data/v0.12 .archive/2025-10-11-migration-to-ideal-structure/
mv worktrees .archive/2025-10-11-migration-to-ideal-structure/
mv consolidated-transparency-data .archive/2025-10-11-migration-to-ideal-structure/
mv releases .archive/2025-10-11-migration-to-ideal-structure/

# Keep archive for 30 days, then delete after verification
```

## Benefits of Ideal Structure

### Developer Experience

**Question**: "Where is California's rights data?"
**Current Answer**: "Uh... try data/v0.12/rights/ or data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/ or worktrees/affirmative/california/data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/ or... I don't know"
**Ideal Answer**: "`data/jurisdictions/states/california/rights.json`"

**Question**: "Where is the Federal statute text?"
**Current Answer**: "Maybe consolidated-transparency-data/statutory-text-files/FEDERAL_FOIA_transparency_law-v0.11.txt?"
**Ideal Answer**: "`data/jurisdictions/federal/statute-full-text.txt`"

### Data Flow Clarity

**Current** (Confusing):
```
Statute → ??? → data/v0.12/??? → worktrees/???/data/v0.12/??? → Neon?
```

**Ideal** (Clear):
```
Official Statute
    ↓
data/jurisdictions/california/statute-full-text.txt (SOURCE OF TRUTH)
    ↓
Extract rights/exemptions
    ↓
data/jurisdictions/california/rights.json (SOURCE OF TRUTH)
    ↓
Generate consolidated (for convenience)
    ↓
data/consolidated/all-rights.json (GENERATED, READ-ONLY)
    ↓
Import to Neon
    ↓
rights_of_access table (DATABASE COPY)
```

### Maintenance Simplicity

**Adding New Jurisdiction**:
```bash
# Current: Complex worktree setup, unclear where files go
# Ideal:
mkdir data/jurisdictions/territories/puerto-rico
# Add 4 files to that folder
# Done.
```

**Updating California**:
```bash
# Current: Find file in worktree? Main repo? Which folder?
# Ideal:
edit data/jurisdictions/states/california/rights.json
# Done.
```

## Migration Checklist

### Data Inventory (What We Have Now)

**In Neon Database** (AUTHORITATIVE):
- 262 verified rights across 14 jurisdictions
- This is THE TRUTH for what's been verified and approved

**In Worktrees** (45 files):
- Each worktree has `{state}/data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/{state}-rights.json`
- Some may be newer than Neon
- Some may be older/duplicates

**In Main Repo**:
- `data/v0.12/rights/federal-rights.json` (probably matches Neon)
- `data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/texas-UNVERIFIED.json` (needs review)

**Statutory Text** (52 files):
- `consolidated-transparency-data/statutory-text-files/*.txt`
- These are complete and verified

**Metadata** (52 files):
- `releases/v0.11.0/jurisdictions/*.json`
- Contains everything from v0.11

### Migration Strategy: Conservative Approach

**Option A: Minimal Changes (Keep What Works)**

1. **Keep existing structure for now**
2. **Just fix the immediate problems**:
   - Add proper .gitignore
   - Remove node_modules from git
   - Delete worktrees (they're not being used correctly anyway)
   - Consolidate rights data to ONE location

3. **Establish convention**:
   - Primary data location: `data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/`
   - All 52 jurisdiction rights files go here
   - Neon database is populated from here
   - That's the single source of truth

**Option B: Full Restructure (Ideal But Risky)**

1. Create ideal structure
2. Migrate all data
3. Update all scripts
4. Test everything
5. Archive old structure

**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Risk**: Medium (complex migration)
**Benefit**: Perfect organization going forward

### My Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

**Phase 1: Quick Wins (Do Now)**
```bash
# 1. Fix .gitignore - Stop tracking node_modules
# 2. Remove worktrees (collect data first)
# 3. Consolidate all rights to: data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/
# 4. Archive old session docs
```

**Result After Phase 1**:
- Repository down to ~300 MB (from 4.7 GB)
- Single location for rights data
- No more Russian nesting dolls
- Still use current folder names (v0.12)

**Phase 2: Gradual Refactor (Do Over Time)**
```bash
# 1. Slowly migrate to data/jurisdictions/ structure
# 2. Update one script at a time
# 3. Test thoroughly
# 4. Eventually archive old v0.12 structure
```

**Result After Phase 2**:
- Perfect organization
- No duplicate data
- Clear naming
- Ideal structure achieved

## Specific Answer to Your Questions

### "Which consolidated data are the real originals?"

**Current Reality**:
- **Neon database is authoritative** for verified data (262 rights, 14 jurisdictions)
- Everything else is staging/drafts/copies

**Ideal Reality**:
- **`data/jurisdictions/{state}/rights.json`** = Source of truth
- **`data/consolidated/all-rights.json`** = Generated (read-only)
- **Neon database** = Production copy (imported from jurisdictions/)

### "Each file should live only in one place"

**Agree 100%**. Current violations:
- federal-rights.json exists in 53 places (main + 52 worktrees)
- CLAUDE.md exists in 53 places
- Every statute text duplicated in worktrees
- Documentation duplicated everywhere

**Ideal**: Each file exists ONCE. Symlinks if needed elsewhere.

### "What would it look like designed from ground up?"

See "Ideal Structure" section above. Key points:
- Jurisdiction-centric folders
- 4 files per jurisdiction (metadata, statute, rights, exemptions)
- Consolidated files are generated (never edited)
- No worktrees (or minimal if needed)
- Clear separation: data/ vs database/ vs docs/ vs scripts/

### "Is it possible without messing anything up?"

**YES** - Using conservative migration:

1. **Build new structure alongside old** (parallel)
2. **Copy data to new locations** (don't move yet)
3. **Verify completeness** (check every file)
4. **Update scripts** (one at a time, test each)
5. **ONLY AFTER FULL VERIFICATION**: Archive old structure

**Timeline**:
- Quick wins (Phase 1): 1 hour, 96% space savings
- Full ideal structure (Phase 2): 2-3 hours over several sessions
- Total: Can be done safely over 2-3 days with checkpoints

## Recommendation

**Execute Phase 1 (Quick Wins) NOW**:
1. Fix .gitignore
2. Stop tracking node_modules
3. Consolidate rights to `data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/`
4. Delete worktrees after data extraction
5. Archive session docs

**Then discuss Phase 2** (migration to ideal structure) after Phase 1 is stable.

**Why This Order**:
- Immediate 96% space savings
- Low risk (mostly removing duplicates)
- Keeps current folder structure (v0.12)
- Gives us clean slate to then migrate to ideal structure

**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Design complete, ready for phased implementation
**Recommended**: Start with conservative Phase 1, then evaluate Phase 2

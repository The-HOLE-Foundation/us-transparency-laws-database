# ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT STATUS: Quality Over Speed

## What Happened

**Problem Discovered**: Agent-generated data passed validation but contains accuracy concerns unsuitable for legal ground truth.

**Action Taken**: Quarantined 47 unverified states, reset to empty templates.

**Current State**: 5/52 verified, 47/52 require manual parsing.

---

## Verified States (5 Total) ‚úÖ

These states were manually parsed and thoroughly verified:

1. **Federal** - Freedom of Information Act
2. **California** - California Public Records Act
3. **Texas** - Texas Public Information Act
4. **New York** - Freedom of Information Law
5. **Pennsylvania** - Right-to-Know Law

**Quality standard**: These 5 represent the expected level of detail and accuracy for all states.

## Quarantined States (47 Total) ‚ö†Ô∏è

All files moved to: `data/QUARANTINE-QUESTIONABLE-DATA-2025-10-03/`

**Why quarantined**:
- Missing source URLs (`source_url: null`)
- Generic citations (chapter-level vs section-specific)
- Schema inconsistencies
- Unverified official law names
- Incomplete URL documentation
- Not manually verified against statutory text

**Files labeled**: `{state}_jurisdiction-data_UNVERIFIED.json`

**States quarantined** (alphabetically):
Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming

## Repository Status

### Current Data State
- ‚úÖ **5/52 verified** (Federal + 4 states)
- ‚è≥ **47/52 empty templates** awaiting manual parsing

### Git Status
- All questionable data preserved in quarantine folder
- All 47 states reset to: `{"jurisdiction":"","transparency_law":"","agencies":[]}`
- Clean commit documenting quarantine action
- Ready for fresh manual parsing work

---

## Manual Parsing Required

### Estimated Time
**47 states √ó 25 minutes average = ~20 hours**

Breaking down by complexity:
- **Simple states** (clear, concise statutes): 15-20 min each
- **Complex states** (multiple laws, recent amendments): 30-45 min each
- **Average**: 25 minutes per state

### Parsing Order (Recommended)

#### Start Here - Priority 1 (Major States)
1. Florida - Public Records Law
2. Illinois - Freedom of Information Act
3. Ohio - Public Records Act
4. Georgia - Open Records Act
5. North Carolina - Public Records Law
6. Michigan - Freedom of Information Act
7. Virginia - Freedom of Information Act
8. Washington - Public Records Act
9. Massachusetts - Public Records Law
10. Arizona - Public Records Law

#### Then Continue A-Z - Priority 2 (Remaining 37)
Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming

## Quality Standards (100% Required)

Every jurisdiction must have:

### Required Fields
- ‚úÖ Exact official law name (verified from statute)
- ‚úÖ Proper statute citation with ¬ß symbol
- ‚úÖ Specific response timelines (not generic)
- ‚úÖ Detailed fee structure with citations
- ‚úÖ Minimum 5 exemption categories with SPECIFIC section citations
- ‚úÖ Complete appeal process with deadlines
- ‚úÖ Official .gov source URLs documented
- ‚úÖ Confidence level: "high"
- ‚úÖ Passes validation script

### Field-Level Requirements

**Citations**:
- ‚ùå WRONG: "MCA Title 2, Ch. 6"
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: "Mont. Code Ann. ¬ß 2-6-1002(2)(a)"

**Source URLs**:
- ‚ùå WRONG: null
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: "https://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/title_0020/chapter_0060/..."

**Law Names**:
- ‚ùå WRONG: "Montana Public Information Law" (generic)
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Exact name from ¬ß 1 of statute

---

## Workflow Per State

### Step 1: Read Statutory Text
```bash
cat consolidated-transparency-data/statutory-text-files/{STATE}_transparency_law-v0.11.txt
```

### Step 2: Extract Data Carefully
- Official law name (exact from statute ¬ß 1)
- Citation with ¬ß symbol
- Response timeline (match ground truth)
- Fee structure with specific rates and citations
- Extract ALL major exemptions with SPECIFIC citations
- Appeal process with timelines and citations
- Official URLs to statute, AG guidance, etc.

### Step 3: Reference Examples
Before creating, review these verified examples:
- `data/federal/jurisdiction-data.json`
- `data/states/california/jurisdiction-data.json`
- `data/states/texas/jurisdiction-data.json`
- `data/states/new-york/jurisdiction-data.json`
- `data/states/pennsylvania/jurisdiction-data.json`

### Step 4: Validate
```bash
python3 scripts/validation/layer2-simple-validation.py --file data/states/{state}/jurisdiction-data.json
```

### Step 5: Manual Quality Check
Before committing, verify:
- [ ] Official law name matches statute exactly
- [ ] Citation includes ¬ß and specific sections
- [ ] Response time matches ground truth
- [ ] All exemptions have specific subsection citations
- [ ] Source URLs point to official .gov sites
- [ ] official_resources fields populated (not null)
- [ ] No generic placeholders

### Step 6: Commit
```bash
git add data/states/{state}/jurisdiction-data.json
git commit -m "feat({state}): Add manually verified Layer 2 metadata

Manually parsed from statutory text with complete verification.
All citations verified, all URLs to official sources documented.

Confidence: high (manually verified)

## Checkpoints

Create validation checkpoints every 10 states:
- After states 10, 20, 30, 40, 47
- Review quality of last 10 completed
- Verify all pass validation
- Ensure consistency with examples
- Check for generic citations
- Verify all URLs populated

---

## What NOT to Do

‚ùå Don't use agents for bulk generation
‚ùå Don't batch commits
‚ùå Don't use generic chapter citations
‚ùå Don't leave source_url as null
‚ùå Don't mark confidence "high" without manual verification
‚ùå Don't skip validation before committing
‚ùå Don't rush - accuracy over speed

---

## Critical Principle

**This database is ground truth for:**
- TheHoleTruth.org platform
- AI training data
- Legal research
- Public education

**One inaccurate data point undermines the entire database's credibility.**

**Manual verification is not optional - it's mandatory.**

---

## Session Resume Command

When ready to begin manual parsing:

```
Read CURRENT_STATUS_2025-10-03.md then read workflows/MANUAL_PARSING_INSTRUCTIONS.md
and begin careful manual parsing starting with Florida.

Take your time. Accuracy is everything.
```

---

## Expected Timeline

- **Session 1** (5 hours): Priority 1 states (10 states)
- **Session 2** (5 hours): States A-L (12 states)
- **Session 3** (5 hours): States M-O (13 states)
- **Session 4** (5 hours): States R-W (12 states)

**Total**: ~20 hours across 4 focused sessions

---

## Honest Assessment

The attempt to use agents for speed backfired. While files passed validation, they contain quality issues that make them unsuitable for legal ground truth:

**Validation catches**:
- Structural errors
- Response time mismatches
- Missing ¬ß symbols

**Validation DOESN'T catch**:
- Wrong official law names
- Generic vs specific citations
- Missing documentation URLs
- Incomplete field population
- Subtle accuracy errors

**Only manual review catches everything.**

---

**Status**: Back to 5/52 verified, 47/52 require manual work
**Quality**: 100% accuracy on 5 states, ready to build on that foundation
**Path forward**: Slow, careful, manual verification of all 47 remaining states

**This is the right decision for data integrity.**

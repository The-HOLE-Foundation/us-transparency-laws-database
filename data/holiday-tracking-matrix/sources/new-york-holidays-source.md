### New York-Specific Holidays
- **Lincoln's Birthday** (February 12): New York State-specific holiday; some bargaining units designate this as a floating holiday
- **Election Day**: New York observes general Election Day as a state holiday (both even and odd years)

### Floating Holidays
The calendar notes that floating holidays for the fiscal year will be updated once designated. Some bargaining units may have different holiday entitlements.

### Holiday Count
Eligible full-time state employees are entitled to 13 holidays per year.

### Legal Authority
All legal holidays are those contained in New York State's General Construction Law. With the exception of Flag Day, all legal holidays are observed as holidays by eligible State employees.

### Additional Information
The holiday calendars do not modify provisions of negotiated agreements or the Civil Service Commission's Attendance Rules. Additional information on holiday benefits is contained in the Attendance and Leave Manual, Section 21.1.

### Bargaining Unit Variations
Holiday entitlements may vary by bargaining unit, and employees should consult their collective bargaining agreements for specific details.

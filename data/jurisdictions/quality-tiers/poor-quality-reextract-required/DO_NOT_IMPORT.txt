⚠️  WARNING: DO NOT IMPORT THESE FILES ⚠️

These 21 jurisdictions have POOR QUALITY data:
- Only 3-9 rights each (should be 15-25)
- Clearly incomplete extraction
- Missing obvious affirmative rights

CURRENT DATABASE STATUS: 31/52 jurisdictions with GOOD data (686 rights)

DO NOT import these files - they will pollute the database with incomplete data.

NEXT STEP: Manual re-extraction from official statutes
- Start with major states (PA, OH, MI, etc.)
- Use California format as template
- Extract 15-25 rights per state
- Verify against current official .gov statute

Once re-extracted with high quality, REPLACE these files and then import.

================================================================================

The public policy of the District of Columbia is that all persons are entitled
to full and complete information regarding the affairs of government and the
official acts of those who represent them as public officials and employees.
To that end, provisions of this subchapter shall be construed with the view
toward expansion of public access and the minimization of costs and time
delays to persons requesting information.

HISTORICAL NOTES:
- Originally enacted: October 21, 1968 (Public Law 90-614)
- Added by D.C. Law 1-96 (March 29, 1977)
- Amended by D.C. Law 13-283 (April 27, 2001)

§ 2-532. Right of access to public records; allowable costs; time limits
================================================================================

(a) Any person has a right to inspect, and at his or her discretion, to copy
any public record of a public body, except as otherwise expressly provided by
§ 2-534, in accordance with reasonable rules that shall be issued by a public
body after notice and comment, concerning the time and place of access.

(a-1) In making any record available to a person pursuant to this section, a
public body shall provide the record in any form or format requested by the
person, provided that the person shall pay the costs of reproducing the record
in that form or format.

(a-2) In responding to a request for records pursuant to this section, a public
body shall make reasonable efforts to search for the records in electronic form
or format, except when such efforts would significantly interfere with the
operation of the public body's automated information system.

(a-3) A public body shall make available for inspection and copying any record
produced or collected pursuant to a contract with a private contractor to
perform a public function, and the public body with programmatic responsibility
for the contractor shall be responsible for making such records available to
the same extent as if the record were maintained by the public body.

(b) A public body may establish and collect fees not to exceed the actual cost
of searching for, reviewing, redacting, and making copies of records. Documents
may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge where a public body
determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest
because furnishing the information can be considered as primarily benefiting
the general public.

(b-1) Fee schedules shall provide for recovery of only the direct costs of
document search, duplication, or review. The fee schedule shall distinguish
between:
  (1) Requests made for commercial use
  (2) Requests made for educational or noncommercial scientific use
  (3) Requests made by news media representatives
  (4) All other requests

Review costs shall not be charged for requests other than commercial use
requests. Review costs may not include any costs incurred in resolving issues
of law or policy that may be raised in processing a request.

(b-2) No public body shall require advance payment of any fee unless the
requester has previously failed to pay fees properly charged, or the public
body has determined that the fee will exceed $250.

(c) A public body shall make a public record accessible for inspection and
copying within 15 business days after a person requests the record, or shall
notify the person of its determination not to disclose the record. The 15
business days shall exclude Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays.

For requests for body-worn camera recordings of the Metropolitan Police
Department, the time period is extended to 25 business days.

(d) The time limit for response set forth in subsection (c) may be extended for
up to 10 business days if unusual circumstances require additional processing
time, including:
  (1) The need to search for and collect requested records from separate
      facilities or archived records storage;
  (2) The need to search for, collect, and examine voluminous records;
  (3) The need for consultation with another public body that has substantial
      interest in the determination or among agency components;

For body-worn camera recordings, if the public body is unable to procure a
body-worn camera recording redaction vendor, the time limit may be extended
for an additional 15 business days.

(e) Failure to respond to a request for records within the time limits set
forth in this section shall be deemed a denial of the request, and the person
may proceed directly to the administrative appeal process provided for in
§ 2-537.

(f) For purposes of this section:
  (1) "Reasonable efforts" means conducting a search reasonably calculated to
      uncover all relevant records.
  (2) "Search" means reviewing manually or electronically agency records for
      the purpose of locating those records responsive to a request.

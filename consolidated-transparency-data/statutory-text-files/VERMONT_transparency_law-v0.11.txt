VERMONT PUBLIC RECORDS ACT - COMPREHENSIVE STATUTORY PROVISIONS

§ 315. POLICY AND PURPOSE

The General Assembly hereby finds that:

(a) A government is the servant of the people and not the master of them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people's right to know is the key to all their liberties.

(b) A democracy cannot function unless the people are permitted to examine the conduct of the people's business. Officers of government are trustees and servants of the people and it is in the public interest to enable any person to review and criticize their decisions even though such examination may cause inconvenience or embarrassment.

(c) All records of government are presumptively public records. The exemptions to this presumption shall be construed narrowly.

(d) The burden of proof shall be on the public agency to sustain its action in denying access to public records.

(e) The provisions of this subchapter shall be liberally construed to implement this policy.

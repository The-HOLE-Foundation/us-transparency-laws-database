(4) "Public record" includes any writing that contains information relating to the conduct of the public's business, including but not limited to court records, mortgages, and deed records, prepared, owned, used or retained by a public body regardless of physical form or characteristics.

(5) "State agency" includes every state officer, department, board, commission, division, institution and institution governing board, but does not include the Legislative Assembly, the courts, the Governor, the Secretary of State, State Treasurer, Attorney General, Commissioner of Labor, or Superintendent of Public Instruction.

(6) "Writing" means handwriting, typewriting, printing, photographing and every means of recording, including letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, files, facsimiles or electronic recordings.

192.314 Policy.
It is the policy of this state that every person has a right to inspect any public record of a public body in this state, except as otherwise expressly provided by ORS 192.311 to 192.478 or other provisions of law.

192.324 Disclosure of public records; fees.
(1) Every public record is open to inspection by any person, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.

(2) A public body that maintains public records in a data base may provide a copy of any public record in the data base to a person upon request, if the public body is able to reasonably describe the public record.

(3) A public body may establish fees reasonably calculated to reimburse it for its actual cost of making public records available for inspection or providing copies of public records, and may require payment in advance. However, a public body may provide copies without charge or at a substantially reduced fee if the public body determines that waiver or reduction of fees is in the public interest because making the record available primarily benefits the general public.

192.329 Public body's response to public records request.
(1) A person may request to inspect or receive a copy of a public record by submitting a request to a public body that:
(a) Is in writing;
(b) Contains the requester's name;
(c) Contains a mailing address or other address, including an electronic mail address, where the public body may send its response to the requester; and
(d) Contains a description of the public record requested.

(2) A public body that receives a request under subsection (1) of this section shall provide the requester with an acknowledgment that the public body received the request. The acknowledgment must be provided to the requester within five business days of the public body's receipt of the request.

(3) A public body that receives a request under subsection (1) of this section shall respond to the request as soon as practicable and without unreasonable delay. Response to the request shall not exceed 15 business days following the public body's receipt of the request unless the public body provides the requester with written justification for a longer response period.

(4) The public body's response under subsection (3) of this section must include one of the following:
(a) The requested public records;
(b) Notice that the requested public records will be provided after the requester pays fees established under ORS 192.324;
(c) A written estimate of the fee required for the public body to provide the requested public records if the public body estimates that the fee will exceed $25, and notice that the public body will provide the requested public records after the requester confirms that the requester wants the public body to proceed with making the public records available and after the requester pays any required fees;
(d) A written statement that describes with reasonable particularity what portion, if any, of the requested public records the public body will make available and what portion of the requested public records the public body is not making available, the specific basis under the law for the public body's determination that a portion of the requested public records are exempt from disclosure, and the right of the requester to seek review under ORS 192.450; or
(e) A written statement that no responsive public records exist or that the public body does not maintain or possess the requested public records.

192.345 Public records conditionally exempt from disclosure.
The following public records are exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.311 to 192.478 unless the public interest requires disclosure in the particular instance:

(1) Information of a personal nature such as but not limited to that kept in a personal, medical or similar file, if public disclosure would constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy, unless the public interest by clear and convincing evidence requires disclosure in the particular instance.

(2) Information submitted to a public body in confidence and not otherwise required by law to be submitted, where such information should reasonably be considered confidential, the public body has obliged itself in good faith not to disclose the information, and when made available to the public would likely:

(b) Impair the ability of the public body to obtain necessary information in the future.

(3) Records, reports, writings, notes, memoranda, or other information obtained by, prepared by, or submitted to the Attorney General, district attorney, or other public body charged with initiating, conducting or coordinating a criminal investigation or prosecution concerning:

(c) The filing of a criminal complaint or an indictment; or
(d) Statements by or the identity of persons interviewed during an investigation.

(4) Trade secrets. "Trade secrets," as used in this subsection, means information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process that:
(a) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use;
(b) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy; and

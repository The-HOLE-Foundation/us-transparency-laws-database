# Repository Clean and Ready for Extraction

## Current State

✅ **Repository Cleaned** - Unnecessary analysis documents archived
✅ **Git Configured** - .gitignore updated to exclude node_modules
✅ **Structure Clear** - Project organization simplified
✅ **Statutory Texts Available** - All verified source texts in repository

## What We Have

### Statutory Text Files
- **Location**: `statutory-data/` and jurisdiction-specific directories
- **Format**: Plain text files with full statute text
- **Status**: Verified from official .gov sources
- **Count**: 52 jurisdictions (50 states + DC + Federal)

### Archive Data
- **Location**: `.archive/2025-10-11-complete-data-backup/`
- **Files**: 46 jurisdiction rights files
- **Status**: EXISTS but provenance unclear
- **Decision**: Ignore for now, extract fresh from statutory texts

### Database
- **Platform**: Neon PostgreSQL
- **Current Data**: 14 jurisdictions with 262 rights
- **Status**: Production but incomplete

## What Needs to Happen

### Simple, Straightforward Process:

**For each of 52 jurisdictions:**

1. **Read** the statutory text file in repository
2. **Identify** affirmative rights (explicit rights granted to citizens)
3. **Document** each right with:
   - Category (Inspection, Timeliness, Fees, Technology, etc.)
   - Statute citation
   - Description
   - Conditions
   - Request tips
4. **Save** as JSON file
5. **Move to next** jurisdiction

**No external research. No complex validation. Just extraction from verified texts.**

## Affirmative Rights - What to Extract

Rights that explicitly grant access or procedural advantages to requesters:

### Categories to Look For:

1. **Inspection Rights**
   - Right to inspect records before copying
   - Right to view during business hours
   - In-person access rights

2. **Timeliness Rights**
   - Statutory response deadlines
   - Deemed denial provisions
   - Fast-track/expedited processing

3. **Fee Protections**
   - Fee waivers (public interest, journalists, researchers)
   - Fee caps or limits
   - First X pages free
   - No search/labor fees

4. **Technology Rights**
   - Electronic format rights
   - No duplication fees for electronic delivery
   - Online submission rights

5. **Enhanced Access Rights**
   - Liberal construction mandates
   - Burden of proof on agency
   - Segregability requirements
   - No purpose/identity requirements

6. **Appeal Rights**
   - Attorney fee recovery
   - De novo judicial review
   - Agency training orders
   - Penalties for improper denials

7. **Proactive Disclosure**
   - Mandatory publication requirements
   - Reading rooms/FOIA libraries
   - Frequently requested records

8. **Requester Protections**
   - No discrimination based on identity
   - Anonymous requests allowed
   - Protection from retaliation

## Work Location

### Where to Create Files

**Main repository**: `data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/`

**File naming**: `{jurisdiction-slug}-rights.json`

Examples:
- `federal-rights.json`
- `california-rights.json`
- `texas-rights.json`

### File Structure Template

```json
{
  "jurisdiction": {
    "slug": "texas",
    "name": "Texas",
    "type": "state",
    "transparency_law": "Texas Public Information Act"
  },
  "validation_metadata": {
    "parsed_date": "2025-10-12",
    "source_file": "TEXAS_transparency_law-v0.11.txt",
    "verified_by": "Claude Code AI Assistant",
    "verification_method": "Direct extraction from statutory text"
  },
  "rights_of_access": [
    {
      "category": "Fee Protections",
      "subcategory": "No Search Fees",
      "statute_citation": "Tex. Gov't Code § 552.261",
      "description": "Governmental body may not charge for employee time spent searching, compiling, or producing records",
      "conditions": "Absolute prohibition on search/labor fees",
      "applies_to": "All requesters",
      "implementation_notes": "Texas completely prohibits labor charges",
      "request_tips": "If charged for search/labor, cite absolute prohibition"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Execution Strategy

### Simple Sequential Approach:

**Start with Federal** (already familiar, good template)
**Then alphabetically by state**: Alabama → Wyoming

**For each jurisdiction:**
1. Open statutory text file
2. Search for access rights language
3. Extract and document
4. Save JSON file
5. Move to next

**Track progress**: Keep list of completed jurisdictions

### Expected Timeline:

- **Federal**: 30 minutes (15 rights)
- **Average state**: 15-20 minutes (5-10 rights)
- **Complex state** (CA, TX, NY): 30-45 minutes (15-20 rights)

**Total estimate**: 15-20 hours for all 52 jurisdictions

## What Changed from Before

### Previous Issues:
- ❌ Complex worktree structure
- ❌ Unclear data provenance
- ❌ Multiple conflicting sources
- ❌ Overthinking validation

### New Approach:
- ✅ Simple file structure
- ✅ Single source of truth (statutory texts)
- ✅ Straightforward extraction
- ✅ Trust the verified statutory texts

## Ready to Start

**Everything needed is in place:**
- ✅ Clean repository
- ✅ Statutory texts verified
- ✅ Clear template
- ✅ Simple process
- ✅ No blockers

**Next step**: Open first statutory text file and start extracting.

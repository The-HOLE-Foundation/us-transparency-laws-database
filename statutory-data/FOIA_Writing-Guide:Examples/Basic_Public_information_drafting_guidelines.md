the first rule of pia drafting is limiting the information shared. do not share why we're asking for records. they have no right or need to know this and it will likely only motivate them to Withhold records.

2. Style - legalistic, straightforward, just the facts.
  - No emotion, justification, frustration, or any other emotional language. these are legal documents and may be used in court. this should always be kept in mind.

3. Cite the statute and the rights of access, pre-emptively address anticipated claims for exemption of records from disclosure. Assume they are not going to willingly provide these records, cut all all avenues of non-disclosure early and often.

4. Cite statutory deadlines, rules, etc - let the know you know what you're doing and you know what you're talkinga about. this will dissuade any ballyhoo.

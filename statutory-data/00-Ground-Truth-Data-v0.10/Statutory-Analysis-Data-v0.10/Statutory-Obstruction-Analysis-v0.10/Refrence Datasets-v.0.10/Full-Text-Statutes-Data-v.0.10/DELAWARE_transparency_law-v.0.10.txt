DELAWARE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT
Delaware Code Title 29, Chapter 100, Sections 10001 through 10008

===================================================

29 DEL. C. § 10001. DECLARATION OF PUBLIC POLICY

It is vital in a democratic society that public business be performed in an open and public manner so that our citizens shall have the opportunity to observe the performance of public officials and to monitor the decisions that are made by such officials in formulating and executing public policy. The General Assembly finds and declares that secrecy in government is inherently inconsistent with a democratic society and that a government that conducts the public's business in secret is not responsive to the needs of the people. Openness in government is essential to accountability in a democratic society, and accountability is impossible without adequate access to information. This chapter shall therefore be liberally construed to promote its underlying purposes.

===================================================

29 DEL. C. § 10002. DEFINITIONS

For the purposes of this chapter:

(1) "Public body" means any regulatory, planning, school, special or other commission, committee, body, board, bureau, agency, service, authority, council, department or officer of the State, or of any political subdivision of the State, empowered by law to exercise any regulatory, administrative, legislative or quasi-judicial power, including committees, subcommittees and other subordinate units thereof; provided, however, that the term "public body" shall not apply to the judicial branch of government or any subordinate unit thereof.

(2) "Public record" means information of any kind, owned, made, used, retained, received, produced, composed, drafted or otherwise compiled or collected, by any public body, relating in any way to public business, or in any way of public interest, or in any way related to public purposes, regardless of the physical form or characteristics of such information, how it is stored, or whether such information is before or after the conclusion of a meeting or proceeding.

===================================================

29 DEL. C. § 10003. EXAMINATION AND COPYING OF PUBLIC RECORDS

(a) All public records shall be subject to inspection and examination by any citizen, and any citizen may obtain copies of any public record.

(b) A request for access to public records shall be made in writing to the appropriate public body.

(c) All state agencies and public bodies shall develop a web portal for receiving FOIA requests through the internet. Such portals shall utilize the standard request form promulgated by the Attorney General.

(d) The public body shall respond to a FOIA request as soon as possible, but in any event within 15 business days after the receipt thereof, either by:
(1) Providing access to the requested records;
(2) Denying access to the records or parts of them pursuant to § 10002(l) and 10004 of this title;
(3) Advising that additional time is needed pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.

(e) If a public body cannot respond within the 15-business-day period because the request is for a voluminous amount of material or requires legal review, the public body may extend the response period for an additional period not to exceed 10 business days by giving written notice to the requesting party within the initial 15-business-day period and stating the reason for the extension.

(f) If a public body fails to respond within the time periods required by subsections (d) and (e) of this section, the request shall be deemed denied.

===================================================

Section 36-12-40. Rights of citizens to inspect and copy public writings; exceptions.

Every citizen has a right to inspect and take a copy of any public writing of this state, except as otherwise expressly provided by statute.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the taking of any public writing from the office or building where it is kept, or to authorize the copying of any public writing if the copying of that public writing would be unduly burdensome to the public officer or employee responsible for such copying. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize any person to inspect or copy any public writing if (1) it is declared to be confidential by law; (2) its disclosure would violate the attorney-client privilege; (3) its disclosure would violate the physician-patient privilege; (4) its disclosure would violate any other legally recognized privilege or the work product doctrine; (5) its disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; (6) its disclosure would violate any other law; or (7) it is a medical record, including any patient record, any record containing medical information relating to an individual, or any record of a person receiving benefits from the Medicaid program.

The exceptions to public access set forth in this section are not all-inclusive.

In this article:
(1) PUBLIC WRITING. Any writing, regardless of form or medium, of any public body or official of the State of Alabama or any political subdivision thereof, including any employee of said public body or official, including any contract with the state or any political subdivision thereof, made in connection with the transaction of public business or the performance of a public function.
(2) WRITING. Words, letters, symbols, or marks set down by handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, magnetic impulse, mechanical or electronic recording, or other form of data compilation upon paper, wood, stone, tape, disc, or other materials.

===================================================

Section 36-12-41. Officials to maintain records.

All public officers and servants of this state and of its counties, cities, towns, and other political subdivisions shall correctly make and accurately keep in and for their respective offices or places of business all such books or sets of books, documents, files, papers, letters and copies of letters as at all times shall afford full and detailed information in reference to the activities or business required to be done or performed by such officers or servants. All such writings, books, documents, files, letters, or other papers shall be deemed public writings and shall be subject to the examination and copying of any citizen of this state as herein provided.

===================================================

Section 36-12-43. Right to copy records; fees.

Any person having a right to inspect a public writing may make or obtain a copy thereof. A reasonable fee may be charged by the public officer or employee responsible for such records for providing the copies. The fee charged shall not exceed the actual cost of reproduction.

In no case shall the fee charged exceed one dollar ($1) per page for copies of not more than 50 pages. For copies in excess of 50 pages, the fee charged shall not exceed fifty cents (50¢) per page.

When copies are requested from a computerized database, the fee charged shall be the actual cost of producing the copies, but not more than the fee that would be charged for hard copies.

===================================================

Section 36-12-44. Response time for records requests by executive agencies.

(a) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
(1) EXECUTIVE AGENCY. A department, board, bureau, commission, agency, or other entity of state government that is within the executive branch and under the jurisdiction of the governor.
(2) STANDARD REQUEST. A request that the custodian of the records estimates can be responded to completely within eight hours, which is one standard working day.
(3) TIME-INTENSIVE REQUEST. A request that will require more than eight hours for the custodian to respond to completely.

(b) Upon receipt of a request to inspect or copy public records, an executive agency shall categorize the request as either a standard request or a time-intensive request.

(c) For a standard request, the executive agency shall acknowledge receipt of the request within three business days of receipt and shall provide a substantive response to the requester within 15 business days of receipt. A substantive response is one of the following:
(1) Providing the requested records.
(2) Providing a partial response with an explanation of any records that were not provided and the reasons why those records were not provided.
(3) Denying the request with an explanation of the reasons for the denial.

(d) For a time-intensive request, the executive agency shall acknowledge receipt of the request within three business days of receipt and shall notify the requester that it is a time-intensive request. The executive agency shall provide a substantive response to the requester within 45 business days of receipt, or the executive agency may extend the response period to a maximum of 180 business days or 270 calendar days, whichever is shorter. The substantive response options are the same as those listed in subsection (c).

(e) An executive agency may require the requester to pay a reasonable fee before providing a substantive response to a standard request. An executive agency shall require the requester to pay a reasonable fee before providing a substantive response to a time-intensive request. If an executive agency elects to charge a fee, it shall notify the requester of the fee and may withhold the record until receipt of payment.

(f) If an executive agency does not respond to a records request or produce the records within the applicable time frames specified in this section, the person making the request may assume that the request is denied.

===================================================

Section 36-12-45. (Repealed by Act 2016-334, §6, effective January 1, 2017.)

===================================================

Section 36-12-46. Discovery proceedings.

Nothing in this article shall be construed to permit any party to a pending or threatened action, suit, or proceeding to obtain information regarding a matter relevant to the pending or threatened action, suit, or proceeding in lieu of the proper discovery methods provided under applicable rules of procedure.

===================================================

ADDITIONAL EXEMPTIONS (Partial List)

The Alabama Legislature has created numerous statutory exceptions to the Open Records Act, including:

1. Registration and circulation records and information concerning the use of public, public school, or college and university libraries
2. Records concerning security plans, procedures, assessments, measures, or systems
3. Banking records
4. Juvenile court records
5. Hospital records
6. Probation reports
7. Identity of Medicaid recipients
8. Reports of suspected disease cases
9. Tax and financial statements
10. Personnel records
11. Attorney-client privileged communications
12. Physician-patient privileged communications
13. Records that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy

===================================================

APPEALS PROCESS

Alabama's Open Records Act does not provide for an administrative appeals process. If an agency denies all or part of a request, the only recourse is to file a lawsuit in the circuit court for the county where the agency is located, seeking a court order requiring the agency to produce the records.

The lawsuit must be filed within two years of the date when the request was denied. In some cases, an agency's delay or failure to respond to a request may be considered a denial that gives the right to sue.

===================================================

REQUESTER QUALIFICATIONS

Only Alabama residents have the right to request public records under the Open Records Act. This includes Alabama-based companies and organizations.

## Common Barriers and 2024 Reform Impact

### Traditional OPRA Barriers (Still Present)
1. **Commercial Designation**: Agencies classify requests as commercial to extend timelines
2. **Excessive Fees**: Special service charges for routine work
3. **Scope Narrowing**: Demanding unreasonable specificity
4. **Partial Denials**: Withholding portions without proper justification

### New 2024 Barriers
1. **Website Redirection**: Agencies may claim records are "available online" when they're not easily accessible
2. **Reduced Attorney Fee Recovery**: Makes enforcement litigation less viable
3. **Anti-Harassment Claims**: Agencies may threaten counter-litigation for persistent requests

### Strategic Responses to 2024 Changes
1. **Website Verification**: Document when claimed online records are not actually accessible
2. **Fee Challenges**: Challenge excessive special service charges more aggressively
3. **GRC Appeals**: Rely more heavily on administrative process given reduced court incentives
4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records to counter harassment claims

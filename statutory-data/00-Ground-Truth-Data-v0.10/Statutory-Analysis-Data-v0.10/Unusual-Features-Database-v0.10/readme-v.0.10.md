This project will use the validated transparency datasets and identity uique or unusual features of state's transparency laws. There are several categories of these. For instance in florida there is a law that you can request records at any time verbally, it doesn't even have to be written down. in virginia and alabama there are residency requirements, and virginia even requires that requestors state the purpsoe of their request and show identificatoin (almost Jim Crow like). i am sure there are many others. Review the full text ofthe transparency statutes and derive this information for each state. create a csv, json, and markdown file for each state and place it in it's own folder, and when you are finished create a master dataset in csv, and json format (we want this to be easily importable to supabase, notion, as well as ready from the beginning for import into ai training models. )

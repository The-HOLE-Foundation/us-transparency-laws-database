WISCONSIN PUBLIC RECORDS LAW - COMPREHENSIVE STATUTORY PROVISIONS

§ 19.31. DECLARATION OF POLICY

LEGISLATIVE POLICY:
In recognition of the fact that a representative government is dependent upon an informed electorate, it is declared to be the public policy of this state that all persons are entitled to the greatest possible information regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of those officers and employees who represent them.

ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT FUNCTION:
Further, providing persons with such information is declared to be an essential function of a representative government and an integral part of the routine duties of officers and employees whose responsibility it is to provide such information.

PRESUMPTION OF ACCESS:
To that end, sections 19.32 to 19.37 shall be construed in every instance with a presumption of complete public access, consistent with the conduct of governmental business. The denial of public access generally is contrary to the public interest, and only in an exceptional case may access be denied.

- State or local office, elective official, agency, board, commission, committee, council, department

- Any court of law
- Assembly or senate
- Nonprofit corporation receiving more than 50% funding from county or municipality

"Record" includes any material on which written, drawn, printed, spoken, visual, or electromagnetic information or electronically generated or stored data is recorded or preserved, regardless of physical form, characteristics, or means of creation, which has been created or is being kept by an authority.

EXCLUSIONS FROM "RECORD":
"Record" does not include:
- Drafts, notes, preliminary computations prepared for originator's personal use
- Materials purely personal property of custodian with no relation to office
- Materials to which access is limited by copyright, patent, or bequest
- Published materials available for sale or inspection at public library

"Record subject" means an individual about whom personally identifiable information is contained in a record.

"Requester" means any person who requests inspection or copies of a record, except a committed or incarcerated person (unless requesting records with specific references to that person or minor children).

§ 19.33. GENERAL POLICY ON ACCESS TO RECORDS

PUBLIC ACCESS RIGHTS:
Except as otherwise provided by law, any requester has a right to inspect any record. Except as otherwise provided by law, any requester has a right to receive a copy of any record.

INSPECTION PROCEDURES:
If the requester appears in person, the authority may, where feasible, permit the inspection to be made immediately. Otherwise, within a reasonable period of time, the authority shall either make the record available or notify the requester in writing that the record is not subject to disclosure and the specific exemption or reason.

§ 19.34. PROCEDURAL INFORMATION

LOCATION NOTIFICATION:
Each authority shall adopt and post whenever feasible for public inspection a notice containing a description of its organization and the established times and places at which, the methods whereby, and the officers or employees from whom, members of the public may obtain information or make requests for inspection or copies of records.

RESPONSE TIMEFRAME:

§ 19.36. RECORD DESTRUCTION PROHIBITED; COPIES

DESTRUCTION PROHIBITION:
No authority may destroy any record at any time after the receipt of a request for inspection or copying of the record until after the request is granted or until at least 60 days after the request is denied or until after any proceeding seeking access to the record is completed.

COPY PROVISIONS:
If an authority receives a request to inspect or copy a record and the record does not exist but the information contained in the record is stored or maintained in electronic form, the authority shall create a record to comply with the request if all of the following apply:

BALANCING TEST:
Authority may permit access to a confidential record if the public interest in allowing inspection and copying outweighs the public interest in maintaining confidentiality.

NOTICE PROCEDURES:
If record subject has a right to notice, authority must provide notice and opportunity to be heard before permitting access to confidential record containing personally identifiable information about the subject.

§ 19.39. LIMITATION ON DISCLOSURE

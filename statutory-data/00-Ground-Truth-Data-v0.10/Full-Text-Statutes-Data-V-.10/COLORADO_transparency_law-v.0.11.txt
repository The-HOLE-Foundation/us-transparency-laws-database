C.R.S. § 24-72-203. INSPECTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS - PROCEDURE

(1)(a) All public records shall be open for inspection by any person at reasonable times, except as provided in this part 2 or as otherwise specifically provided by law.

(b) The custodian shall make available a suitable place for the inspection of public records, and no person shall remove original public records from such designated place without the permission of the custodian.

(2) Any person may inspect any public record upon written application to the custodian. Such application need only describe the record requested with sufficient specificity to enable the custodian to locate the requested record.

(3) RESPONSE TIMEFRAMES (CURRENT LAW - SB25-077 CHANGES VETOED):
The custodian shall provide the requested records or shall deny the request in writing within three working days after the receipt of the application. If extenuating circumstances exist, the custodian may extend such three-day period for up to seven additional working days by providing written notice of the extension to the applicant within the initial three-working-day period and by stating the reasons for the extension in such written notice.

NOTE ON PROPOSED CHANGES: SB25-077 would have extended these timeframes to 5 working days and 10 additional days respectively, with media exemptions, but was VETOED by Governor Polis on April 17, 2025, citing concerns about reduced government transparency.

(4)(a) If the requested records are not in the custodian's immediate custody or control, the custodian may so advise the applicant and shall make reasonable efforts to notify the applicant where the records are located.

(b) If the custodian has transferred permanent custody of the requested records to the state archives, the custodian shall so advise the applicant.

CURRENT REQUIREMENTS FOR CUSTODIANS NOT AVAILABLE:
If the person with custody of records is not available during the response period, the custodian must provide all other available responsive records and notify the requester of when the custodian will return or if they are not expected to return.

(5)(a) If the custodian denies a records request, the custodian shall provide a written statement of the grounds for denial, including the specific statutory citation to an exemption in section 24-72-204.

(b) Prior to seeking judicial review of the denial, a person denied access to records may file a written request with the custodian for reconsideration of the denial. Such request for reconsideration may include an offer to meet and confer with the custodian to discuss the scope and basis of the request.

(6) FEES - RESEARCH AND RETRIEVAL:
The custodian may charge a research and retrieval fee if more than one hour of staff time is necessary to produce the requested records for inspection or copying, except that no research and retrieval fee shall be charged for the first hour of staff time.

Current rate: $33.58 per hour (2025 rate) for time exceeding one hour

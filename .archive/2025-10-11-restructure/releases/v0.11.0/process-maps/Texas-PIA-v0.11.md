## Legal Framework

### Primary Statute
**Texas Government Code Chapter 552** (Current through September 1, 2025)

### Core Principle
Public information belongs to the people and governmental bodies are trustees of this information.

### 2025 Legislative Updates - HB 4219 (EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 1, 2025)
- **10-Day "No Records" Notification**: NEW mandatory written response for no records determinations
- **Previous AG Determinations Rule**: Agencies cannot re-litigate identical exemption claims
- **Expedited Notification**: 10 business days for citing previous AG rulings
- **Expanded Contracting Transparency**: Communications and performance records now presumptively public
- **Enhanced Personnel Record Disclosure**: Basic employment information presumptively public
- **Limited AG Appeals**: Only novel questions or unique factual circumstances
- **Strengthened Penalties**: Criminal penalties for misusing AG appeal process
- **Open Records Hotline**: Section 552.013 (effective April 1, 2025)

---

## Response Timeline Framework (2025 - AMENDED BY HB 4219)

### Standard Response Period
- **Initial Deadline**: **10 business days** from receipt of request
- **Calculation**: Excludes weekends, state holidays, and days the office is closed
- **Start Date**: Day after request is received

### NEW: "No Records" Notification Requirement (HB 4219)
**Section 552.221(b) - EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 1, 2025**

If a governmental body determines either:
1. **No responsive records exist**, OR
2. **Requested information is excepted** from disclosure AND the exception has been previously determined in a written AG opinion or court decision

Then the agency MUST notify the requester in writing within **10 business days**.

**Significance**: This closes a previous loophole where agencies could delay indefinitely by claiming no records without formal response.

### The "Clarification Pause" Mechanism ⚠️
**CONFIRMED: Primary obstruction tool - PARTIALLY LIMITED BY HB 4219**

**How It Works**:
1. Agency receives request within 10-day deadline
2. Agency claims request is "unclear" or needs "clarification"
3. **10-day statutory clock PAUSES indefinitely**
4. Clock does not resume until requester provides "clarification"
5. No limit on how long pause can last

**Legal Basis**:
- Recognized in Texas Government Code Chapter 552
- Upheld in case law including City of Dallas v. Abbott precedent
- Must be "reasonable" but standard remains subjective

**HB 4219 Impact**: While not eliminating clarification pauses, HB 4219's "no records" notification requirement and previous determination rule reduce some delay tactics.

**Strategic Abuse Pattern**:
- Used as "stop number one" when agencies don't want to release records
- Requests for clarification often themselves unclear or overly broad
- Creates indefinite delay without violating letter of the law

### Attorney General Review Process - AMENDED BY HB 4219

**NEW RESTRICTIONS (Section 552.301 - Amended 2025)**:

A governmental body **may not** request an AG decision if the AG has previously issued a written decision concluding that identical or substantially identical information is excepted from required disclosure, **unless**:
1. The previous decision has been overruled by a court of competent jurisdiction
2. The information involves different factual circumstances
3. There has been a change in applicable law since the previous decision

**NEW: Limited Scope for AG Requests**:
A governmental body may request an AG decision only for:
1. Novel questions of law not previously addressed
2. Information involving unique factual circumstances
3. Requests where competing exemptions create genuine legal uncertainty

**Enhanced Transparency Requirements (Section 552.302 - Amended 2025)**:
When submitting a request for AG decision, agencies must:
- Identify any previous AG rulings on similar information
- Explain why the current request presents novel legal issues
- Provide specific factual basis for claimed exemptions
- Demonstrate good faith efforts to release non-exempt portions

**Timeline**: Still no fixed deadline for AG opinion, but scope is now limited
**Effect**: Should reduce delays from repetitive AG appeals on settled issues

## Fee Structure (VERIFIED 2025)

### Programming Time Charges
- **Hourly Rate**: **$15-40 per hour** (confirmed current range)
- **Basis**: Actual labor costs of staff performing work
- **No Minimum**: Can charge for any amount of programming time
- **Pre-payment**: May require deposit before work begins

### Other Permitted Charges (Section 552.261)
- **Copying Costs**: $1 per standard page maximum
- **Labor Time**: Actual cost for search, compilation, redaction
- **Overhead**: Generally NOT allowed per statute
- **Materials**: Actual cost of paper, electronic media, postage

### Fee Waiver Criteria
- **Public Interest**: Information primarily benefits public rather than requester
- **Cost of Collection**: If fee collection costs more than the fee
- **Media Requests**: May qualify under public interest standard

### Strategic Fee Barriers
1. **Excessive Estimates**: Inflate programming time projections
2. **Deposit Requirements**: Demand large upfront payments
3. **Scope Expansion**: Interpret requests broadly to increase fees
4. **Technical Complexity**: Claim simple requests require programming

---

## NEW: Expanded Presumptive Disclosure Categories (HB 4219)

### Section 552.022 - AMENDED 2025

**NEW: CONTRACTING DOCUMENTS** (Presumptively public):
- Records showing whether contractor has met duties under contract
- Contract amendments and modifications
- Progress reports and performance evaluations
- Performance measures and metrics

- Final inspection reports and acceptance documents

**NEW: INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH CONTRACTORS** (Presumptively public):

- Communications related to work performed under final contracts
- Project status updates and coordination communications
- **Exception**: Attorney-client privileged communications remain confidential

**EXPANDED: PERSONNEL INFORMATION** (Presumptively public):
While comprehensive personnel files remain protected, the following are presumptively public:
- Basic employment information (position, salary, dates of employment)
- Job-related performance evaluations not protected by privacy exemptions
- Training records and certifications
- Work-related disciplinary actions (with privacy redactions as appropriate)
- **Exception**: Personal contact information, medical records, certain disciplinary matters remain confidential

### Phase 2: Agency Response (THE CRITICAL PHASE - AMENDED BY HB 4219)

**Day 1-10: Standard Response Window**

Agency must either:
- Release the information
- **NEW**: Provide written "no records" notification within 10 business days
- **NEW**: Cite previous AG determination within 10 business days (if applicable)
- Seek Attorney General opinion to withhold (only for novel issues)

- Must be provided in writing within 10 business days
- Applies when no responsive records exist
- Applies when records covered by previous AG determination
- Must cite specific AG ruling number and date if applicable

**Clarification Request Tactics (STILL IN USE)**:
- "Please clarify what specific documents you want"

**Strategic Response to Clarification Requests**:
- Challenge unnecessary clarification requests in writing

- Genuine legal uncertainty from competing exemptions

**When It Occurs**: Agency claims exemption applies
**Timeline**: No fixed deadline for AG opinion

Agency must identify previous AG rulings and explain why request presents novel issues

### Phase 5: Record Production or Final Denial

**Upon AG Opinion**: Agency must follow AG determination

---

## Common Barriers and Workarounds

### The Texas "Clarification Games" 🎯
**Barrier**: Vague clarification requests to pause deadlines (STILL AVAILABLE UNDER HB 4219)

**Response Strategies**:
1. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of all requests and responses
2. **Push Back Immediately**: Challenge unreasonable clarification requests in writing
3. **Provide Minimal Changes**: Give shortest possible response that addresses request
4. **Set Deadlines**: Request agency respond to clarification within specific timeframe
5. **Escalate Quickly**: Contact agency head if clarification requests are abusive
6. **NEW**: Cite HB 4219's enhanced penalties for bad faith delays

### Programming Fee Inflation 💰
**Barrier**: Claiming routine searches require expensive programming

**Response Strategies**:
1. **Challenge Characterization**: Argue request is routine database query
2. **Request Alternatives**: Ask for different format that avoids programming
3. **Compare Costs**: Reference similar requests fulfilled without programming
4. **Demand Justification**: Require detailed explanation of programming necessity
5. **NEW**: Reference expanded contracting and personnel disclosure categories

### Attorney General Review Delays ⏰ (REDUCED BY HB 4219)
**Barrier**: Agencies use AG review process to delay even clearly releasable records

**HB 4219 IMPROVEMENTS**:
- Agencies cannot request AG decisions on settled exemption questions
- Must cite previous AG rulings within 10 days
- Enhanced submission requirements increase transparency

**Response Strategies**:
1. **Challenge Exemption Claims**: File comments with AG opposing withholding

- Costs: Can be significant but recoverable if successful
- **NEW**: Enhanced grounds for mandamus under HB 4219

### Strategic Litigation Considerations
- Texas has strong pro-disclosure presumption

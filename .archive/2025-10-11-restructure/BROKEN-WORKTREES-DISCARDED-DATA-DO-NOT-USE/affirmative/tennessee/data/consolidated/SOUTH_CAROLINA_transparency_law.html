</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">&sect; 30-4-10. Legislative intent.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">The General Assembly finds that it is vital in a democratic society that public business be performed in an open and public manner so that citizens shall be advised of the performance of public officials and of the decisions that are reached in public activity and in the formulation of public policy. Toward this end, provisions of this chapter must be construed so as to make it possible for citizens, or their representatives, to learn and report fully the activities of their public officials and the deliberations and decisions that go into the making of public policy. The General Assembly further finds that permitting secrecy to shroud the actions of public officials can only lead to inefficiency, wastefulness, and corruption in the governmental process.

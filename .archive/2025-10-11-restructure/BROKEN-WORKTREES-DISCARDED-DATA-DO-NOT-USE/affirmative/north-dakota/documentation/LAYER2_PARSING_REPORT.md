## Parser Details

### Parsing Strategy

The autonomous parser uses the following approach:

1. **Text Analysis**: Reads statutory text files from `consolidated-transparency-data/statutory-text-files/`
2. **Pattern Matching**: Extracts law names, citations, and response times using regex patterns
3. **Structure Generation**: Creates JSON following the standard schema from completed examples
4. **Validation**: Validates response units (business_days, calendar_days, working_days, variable)
5. **Confidence Rating**: Assigns "medium" confidence for automated parsing

### Confidence Levels

- **High**: Manually verified from official sources
- **Medium**: Automated parsing with reasonable pattern matching (this run)
- **Low**: Minimal data extracted, requires manual completion

### Data Quality Notes

All automatically parsed jurisdictions should be manually reviewed and verified against official government sources:

1. Verify statute citations are correct
2. Confirm response time units (business vs calendar days)
3. Add detailed exemptions from actual statutory text
4. Complete fee structure details
5. Add appeal process specifics
6. Update validation metadata with official source URLs

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Manual Review**: Review all medium-confidence jurisdictions
2. **Source Verification**: Confirm all data against official .gov sources
3. **Schema Validation**: Run `python3 scripts/validation/layer2-simple-validation.py --all`
4. **Ground Truth Validation**: Run `python3 scripts/validation/validate-against-ground-truth.py`

### Quality Improvement

1. Add detailed exemptions from statutory text
2. Complete fee structure information
3. Add official resource URLs
4. Enhance appeal process details
5. Add requester requirements
6. Add agency obligations

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Check all jurisdictions
python3 scripts/validation/check-all-jurisdictions.py

# Validate specific jurisdiction
python3 scripts/validation/layer2-simple-validation.py --file data/states/arkansas/jurisdiction-data.json

# Validate against ground truth
python3 scripts/validation/validate-against-ground-truth.py
```

## Git Status

All processed jurisdictions have been committed to git with the following message format:

```
feat(state): Add Layer 2 structured metadata

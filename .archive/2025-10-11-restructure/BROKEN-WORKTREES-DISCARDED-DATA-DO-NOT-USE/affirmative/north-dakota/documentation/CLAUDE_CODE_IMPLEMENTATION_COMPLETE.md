## 🚀 How to Use This Implementation

### Starting a New Session

1. **Review CLAUDE.md**
   ```
   "What workflow patterns are available for [task I want to accomplish]?"
   ```

2. **Classify Your Task**
   - Autonomous? Use auto-accept mode (shift+tab)
   - Supervised? Work synchronously with monitoring
   - Critical? Propose solution first for review

3. **Create Checkpoint** (if autonomous)
   ```bash
   git add . && git commit -m "checkpoint: before [task-name]"
   ```

4. **Execute Workflow** (if applicable)
   ```
   "Run workflows/add-jurisdiction.md for California"
   ```

5. **Use Custom Commands**
   ```
   /sync-supabase
   /validate-accuracy Texas
   /ai-foundry-status
   ```

### During Session

- **Track Progress**: Update todos as you work
- **Document Learnings**: Note effective patterns
- **Handle Errors**: Follow emergency procedures in CLAUDE.md
- **Ask for Help**: Reference specific CLAUDE.md sections

### Ending Session

1. **Generate Summary**
   ```
   "Create session summary using template at documentation/SESSION_SUMMARY_TEMPLATE.md"
   ```

2. **Review Learnings**
   - What worked well?
   - What could improve?
   - Any CLAUDE.md updates needed?

3. **Plan Next Session**
   - Prioritize tasks
   - Note any blockers
   - Schedule follow-up work

4. **Save Summary**
   ```bash
   # Save as: documentation/sessions/SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD.md
   git add . && git commit -m "docs: Add session summary for YYYY-MM-DD"
   ```

## 🔄 Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Adding Texas Transparency Law

```bash
# 1. Create checkpoint
git commit -m "checkpoint: before adding Texas"

# 2. Execute workflow
"Run workflows/add-jurisdiction.md for Texas with:
- Citation: Tex. Gov't Code § 552
- URL: https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/GV/htm/GV.552.htm
- Response timeline: 10 business days
- Fee: $0.10 per page after first 50 pages"

# 3. Claude autonomously:
#    - Creates directory structure
#    - Populates template
#    - Creates process map
#    - Updates tracking table
#    - Runs validation
#    - Creates git commit

# 4. Review and approve
git log -1  # Check commit message
git diff HEAD~1  # Review changes

# 5. If good, push; if issues, rollback
git push  # Success!
# OR
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Rollback and retry
```

### Example 2: Syncing Supabase

```bash
# 1. Use slash command
/sync-supabase

# 2. Claude executes workflow:
#    - Analyzes JSON structure
#    - Generates migrations
#    - Updates TypeScript types
#    - Populates database
#    - Verifies integrity

# 3. Review output
pnpm supabase status  # Check health

# 4. Test API
curl http://localhost:54321/rest/v1/jurisdictions

# 5. Deploy to production when ready
```

### Example 3: Integrating AI Foundry

```bash
# 1. Execute integration workflow
"Run workflows/integrate-ai-foundry.md"

# 2. Claude builds:
#    - React component
#    - Backend API proxy
#    - Authentication flow
#    - Rate limiting
#    - Error handling

# 3. Test integration
npm run dev
# Navigate to /foia-generator

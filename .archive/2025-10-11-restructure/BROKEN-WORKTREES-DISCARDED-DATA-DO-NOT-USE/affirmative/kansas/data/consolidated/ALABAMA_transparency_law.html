<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">Alabama's Open Records Act does not provide for an administrative appeals process.

</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">The lawsuit must be filed within two years of the date when the request was denied. In some cases, an agency's delay or failure to respond to a request may be considered a denial that gives the right to sue.

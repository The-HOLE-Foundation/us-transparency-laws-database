</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(b)  Except as provided by Subsections (c) through (i), the governing body of a public retirement system is subject to this chapter in the same manner as a governmental body.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(c)  Records of individual members, annuitants, retirees, beneficiaries, alternate payees, program participants, or persons eligible for benefits from a retirement system under a retirement plan or program administered by the retirement system that are in the custody of the system or in the custody of an administering firm, a carrier, or another governmental agency, including the comptroller, acting in cooperation with or on behalf of the retirement system are confidential and not subject to public disclosure.  The retirement system, administering firm, carrier, or governmental agency is not required to accept or comply with a request for a record or information about a record or to seek an opinion from the attorney general because the records are exempt from the provisions of this chapter, except as otherwise provided by this section.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(d)  Records may be released to a member, annuitant, retiree, beneficiary, alternate payee, program participant, or person eligible for benefits from the retirement system or to an authorized attorney, family member, or representative acting on behalf of the member, annuitant, retiree, beneficiary, alternate payee, program participant, or person eligible for benefits.  The retirement system may release the records to:
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(1)  an administering firm, carrier, or agent or attorney acting on behalf of the retirement system;
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(2)  another governmental entity having a legitimate need for the information to perform the purposes of the retirement system; or
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(3)  a party in response to a subpoena issued under applicable law.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(e)  A record released or received by the retirement system under this section may be transmitted electronically, including through the use of an electronic signature or certification in a form acceptable to the retirement system.  An unintentional disclosure to, or unauthorized access by, a third party related to the transmission or receipt of information under this section is not a violation by the retirement system of any law, including a law or rule relating to the protection of confidential information.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(f)  The records of an individual member, annuitant, retiree, beneficiary, alternate payee, program participant, or person eligible for benefits from the retirement system remain confidential after release to a person as authorized by this section. The records may become part of the public record of an administrative or judicial proceeding related to a contested case, and the member, annuitant, retiree, beneficiary, alternate payee, program participant, or person eligible for benefits waives the confidentiality of the records, including medical records, unless the records are closed to public access by a protective order issued under applicable law.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(g)  The retirement system may require a person to provide the person's social security number as the system considers necessary to ensure the proper administration of all services, benefits, plans, and programs under the retirement system's administration, oversight, or participation or as otherwise required by state or federal law.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(h)  The retirement system has sole discretion in determining whether a record is subject to this section.  For purposes of this section, a record includes any identifying information about a person, living or deceased, who is or was a member, annuitant, retiree, beneficiary, alternate payee, program participant, or person eligible for benefits from the retirement system under any retirement plan or program administered by the retirement system.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(i)  To the extent of a conflict between this section and any other law with respect to the confidential information held by a public retirement system or other entity described by Subsection (c) concerning an individual member, annuitant, retiree, beneficiary, alternate payee, program participant, or person eligible for benefits from the retirement system, the prevailing provision is the provision that provides the greater substantive and procedural protection for the privacy of information concerning that individual member, annuitant, retiree, beneficiary, alternate payee, program participant, or person eligible for benefits.

A governmental body, by providing public information under this section that is confidential or otherwise excepted from required disclosure under law, does not waive or affect the confidentiality of the information for purposes of state or federal law or waive the right to assert exceptions to required disclosure of the information in the future.  The governmental body may require the requesting individual member of the legislature, the requesting legislative agency or committee, or the members or employees of the requesting entity who will view or handle information that is received under this section and that is confidential under law to sign a confidentiality agreement that covers the information and requires that:

The attorney general shall issue a written decision on the matter and provide a copy of the decision to the requestor, the governmental body, and any interested person who submitted necessary information or a brief to the attorney general about the matter.  The requestor or the governmental body may appeal a decision of the attorney general under this subsection to a Travis County district court.

The rules adopted by the attorney general shall be used by each governmental body in determining charges for providing copies of public information and in determining the charge, deposit, or bond required for making public information that exists in a paper record available for inspection, except to the extent that other law provides for charges for specific kinds of public information.  The charges for providing copies of public information may not be excessive and may not exceed the actual cost of producing the information or for making public information that exists in a paper record available for inspection.  A governmental body, other than an agency of state government, may determine its own charges for providing copies of public information and its own charge, deposit, or bond for making public information that exists in a paper record available for inspection but may not charge an amount that is greater than 25 percent more than the amount established by the attorney general unless the governmental body requests an exemption under Subsection (c).

The request must be made in writing to the attorney general and must state the reason for the exemption.  If the attorney general determines that good cause exists for exempting a governmental body from a part or all of the rules, the attorney general shall give written notice of the determination to the governmental body within 90 days of the request.  On receipt of the determination, the governmental body may amend its charges for providing copies of public information or its charge, deposit, or bond required for making public information that exists in a paper record available for inspection according to the determination of the attorney general.

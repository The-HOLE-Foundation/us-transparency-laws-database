# v0.12 Feature: Rights of Access Table

## Overview

Version 0.12 introduces a dedicated `rights_of_access` table to document **affirmative rights** to public records in each jurisdiction. This mirrors the `exemptions` table structure but focuses on what requesters **CAN** access rather than what they cannot.

## Rationale

### Problem Statement
Currently, the database documents **exemptions** (what cannot be accessed) but lacks structured documentation of **affirmative rights** (what CAN be accessed). This creates an incomplete picture for:

1. **FOIA Request Writers**: Cannot effectively assert specific statutory rights in requests
2. **Requester Education**: Users see barriers but not opportunities
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Cannot compare access rights across jurisdictions
4. **AI-Powered Request Generation**: FOIA Generator lacks positive assertions to include in requests

### Solution
A `rights_of_access` table that catalogs:
- Statutory rights to specific record types
- Affirmative access provisions
- Proactive disclosure requirements
- Enhanced access for specific requesters (journalists, researchers, etc.)
- Technology-specific access rights (electronic formats, APIs, etc.)

## Table Schema Design

### Table: `rights_of_access`

Mirrors the `exemptions` table structure for consistency:

```sql
CREATE TABLE rights_of_access (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    transparency_law_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES transparency_laws(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    -- Jurisdiction denormalization (for efficient queries)
    jurisdiction_slug TEXT NOT NULL,
    jurisdiction_name TEXT NOT NULL,

    -- Right classification
    category TEXT NOT NULL,              -- e.g., 'Proactive Disclosure', 'Enhanced Access', 'Technology Rights'
    subcategory TEXT,                    -- e.g., 'Meeting Records', 'Budget Documents', 'API Access'

    -- Legal foundation
    statute_citation TEXT,               -- Specific statutory citation
    description TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Clear description of the right

    -- Conditions and scope
    conditions TEXT,                     -- Conditions for exercising this right
    applies_to TEXT,                     -- Who can exercise this right (if limited)

    -- Implementation details
    implementation_notes TEXT,           -- How agencies implement this right
    request_tips TEXT,                   -- Tips for asserting this right in requests

    -- Metadata
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_rights_of_access_law ON rights_of_access(transparency_law_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_rights_of_access_jurisdiction ON rights_of_access(jurisdiction_slug);
CREATE INDEX idx_rights_of_access_category ON rights_of_access(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_rights_of_access_subcategory ON rights_of_access(subcategory);

-- Full-text search
CREATE INDEX idx_rights_of_access_description ON rights_of_access USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', description));

-- RLS Policies (read-only public access)
ALTER TABLE rights_of_access ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Rights of access are viewable by everyone"
    ON rights_of_access FOR SELECT
    USING (true);

-- Trigger for updated_at
CREATE TRIGGER update_rights_of_access_updated_at
    BEFORE UPDATE ON rights_of_access
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

-- Comments
COMMENT ON TABLE rights_of_access IS 'Affirmative rights of access to public records by jurisdiction';
COMMENT ON COLUMN rights_of_access.category IS 'Primary classification: Proactive Disclosure, Enhanced Access, Technology Rights, etc.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN rights_of_access.description IS 'Clear description of what can be accessed under this right';
COMMENT ON COLUMN rights_of_access.conditions IS 'Conditions or requirements for exercising this right';
COMMENT ON COLUMN rights_of_access.request_tips IS 'Tips for asserting this right in FOIA requests';
```

## Category Taxonomy

### Primary Categories

   - Records agencies must publish without request
   - Public meeting agendas/minutes
   - Budget documents
   - Contracts and spending
   - Employee salary databases

2. **Enhanced Access Rights**
   - Expedited processing for specific requesters
   - Fee waivers for journalists/researchers
   - Special access provisions
   - Confidential source protections

3. **Technology Rights**
   - Electronic format requirements
   - API access provisions
   - Machine-readable data rights
   - Open data portal access

4. **Requester-Specific Rights**
   - Journalist privileges
   - Academic researcher access
   - Nonprofit organization rights
   - Citizen oversight provisions

5. **Inspection Rights**
   - On-site record inspection
   - Copy-on-demand provisions
   - Photography/scanning rights
   - Access to equipment/facilities

6. **Timeliness Rights**
   - Statutory response deadlines
   - Interim response requirements
   - Deemed-granted provisions
   - Emergency access procedures

## Data Collection Strategy

### Phase 1: High-Priority States (Weeks 1-4)
Focus on 10 jurisdictions with robust access provisions:
1. Federal (FOIA)
2. California
3. Washington
4. New York
5. Texas
6. Florida
7. Illinois
8. Massachusetts
9. Oregon
10. Connecticut

### Phase 2: All Remaining States (Weeks 5-12)
Complete remaining 42 jurisdictions

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Weeks 13-16)
- Add request_tips for all rights
- Cross-reference with exemptions
- Create comparative analysis views

## Data Sources (Official Only)

Following existing validation methodology:

### Acceptable Sources:
1. **State Statutes** (official .gov legislature sites)
2. **Official AG Opinions** on access rights
3. **State Attorney General FOIA Handbooks**
4. **Official State Records Office Guides**
5. **Court Decisions** (official state judiciary sites)

### Prohibited Sources:
- AI summaries (Perplexity, ChatGPT, etc.)
- Third-party legal commentary
- News articles or blog posts
- Unofficial guides

## Integration with Existing Data

### Relationship to Exemptions
Rights and exemptions work together:
- **Exemptions**: What cannot be accessed
- **Rights of Access**: What CAN be accessed
- Together they define the complete legal landscape

### FOIA Generator Enhancement
The FOIA Generator can now:
1. **Assert Specific Rights**: "Under [statute citation], I have the right to..."
2. **Cite Affirmative Provisions**: Reference specific access rights
3. **Leverage Technology Rights**: Request machine-readable formats when applicable
4. **Claim Enhanced Access**: Identify journalist/researcher status when relevant

### Example Request Enhancement

**Before (v0.11):**
> "I request copies of all contracts over $10,000 signed in 2024."

**After (v0.12):**
> "Under Cal. Gov. Code ยง 7927.700, which requires proactive disclosure of contracts exceeding $10,000, I request copies of all such contracts signed in 2024. Additionally, pursuant to ยง 7927.315, I request these records in an electronic format suitable for analysis."

## Database Views

### View: `transparency_landscape`
Combines rights and exemptions for complete picture:

```sql
CREATE VIEW transparency_landscape AS
SELECT
    j.slug,
    j.name AS jurisdiction_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ra.id) AS total_rights,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) AS total_exemptions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ra.id) FILTER (WHERE ra.category = 'Proactive Disclosure') AS proactive_disclosure_rights,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ra.id) FILTER (WHERE ra.category = 'Technology Rights') AS technology_rights,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) FILTER (WHERE e.category = 'Law Enforcement') AS law_enforcement_exemptions
FROM jurisdictions j
LEFT JOIN transparency_laws tl ON tl.jurisdiction_id = j.id
LEFT JOIN rights_of_access ra ON ra.transparency_law_id = tl.id
LEFT JOIN exemptions e ON e.transparency_law_id = tl.id
GROUP BY j.slug, j.name
ORDER BY total_rights DESC;
```

## Impact on FOIA Generator

### Enhanced Request Templates

The FOIA Generator can now generate requests like:

```
Subject: Public Records Request - [Topic]

Dear Records Officer,

I am writing to request access to [records] under the [State] Public Records Act.

STATUTORY RIGHTS ASSERTED:

1. Proactive Disclosure Right (ยง X.XX): These records are required to be proactively
   disclosed, so I request access to the publicly available materials.

2. Electronic Format Right (ยง Y.YY): I request these records in electronic format
   as they are maintained electronically by your agency.

3. Expedited Processing (ยง Z.ZZ): As a working journalist with [publication]
   covering [topic], I request expedited processing under the journalist
   provision with a 5-day response deadline.

REQUEST DETAILS:
[Specific records requested]

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
```

## Common Barriers and 2024 Reform Impact

### Traditional OPRA Barriers (Still Present)

3. **Anti-Harassment Claims**: Agencies may threaten counter-litigation for persistent requests

### Strategic Responses to 2024 Changes
1. **Website Verification**: Document when claimed online records are not actually accessible
2. **Fee Challenges**: Challenge excessive special service charges more aggressively
3. **GRC Appeals**: Rely more heavily on administrative process given reduced court incentives
4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records to counter harassment claims

## 2024 Reform Assessment

### Texas PIA

# Texas Public Information Act - VERIFIED Process Map

## VERIFICATION CERTIFICATION
**STATUS**: VERIFIED ACCURATE
**VERIFICATION DATE**: September 26, 2025
**VERIFICATION SOURCE**: Texas Government Code Chapter 552 including HB 4219 amendments
**LAST STATUTORY UPDATE**: September 1, 2025 (HB 4219 effective date)
**VERSION**: v0.11

---

## Legal Framework

### Primary Statute
**Texas Government Code Chapter 552** (Current through September 1, 2025)

### Core Principle
Public information belongs to the people and governmental bodies are trustees of this information.

### 2025 Legislative Updates - HB 4219 (EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 1, 2025)
- **10-Day "No Records" Notification**: NEW mandatory written response for no records determinations
- **Previous AG Determinations Rule**: Agencies cannot re-litigate identical exemption claims
- **Expedited Notification**: 10 business days for citing previous AG rulings
- **Expanded Contracting Transparency**: Communications and performance records now presumptively public
- **Enhanced Personnel Record Disclosure**: Basic employment information presumptively public
- **Limited AG Appeals**: Only novel questions or unique factual circumstances
- **Strengthened Penalties**: Criminal penalties for misusing AG appeal process
- **Open Records Hotline**: Section 552.013 (effective April 1, 2025)

---

## Response Timeline Framework (2025 - AMENDED BY HB 4219)

### Standard Response Period
- **Initial Deadline**: **10 business days** from receipt of request
- **Calculation**: Excludes weekends, state holidays, and days the office is closed
- **Start Date**: Day after request is received

### NEW: "No Records" Notification Requirement (HB 4219)
**Section 552.221(b) - EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 1, 2025**

If a governmental body determines either:
1. **No responsive records exist**, OR
2. **Requested information is excepted** from disclosure AND the exception has been previously determined in a written AG opinion or court decision

Then the agency MUST notify the requester in writing within **10 business days**.

**Significance**: This closes a previous loophole where agencies could delay indefinitely by claiming no records without formal response.

### The "Clarification Pause" Mechanism ⚠️
**CONFIRMED: Primary obstruction tool - PARTIALLY LIMITED BY HB 4219**

**How It Works**:
1. Agency receives request within 10-day deadline
2. Agency claims request is "unclear" or needs "clarification"
3. **10-day statutory clock PAUSES indefinitely**
4. Clock does not resume until requester provides "clarification"
5. No limit on how long pause can last

**Legal Basis**:
- Recognized in Texas Government Code Chapter 552
- Upheld in case law including City of Dallas v. Abbott precedent
- Must be "reasonable" but standard remains subjective

**HB 4219 Impact**: While not eliminating clarification pauses, HB 4219's "no records" notification requirement and previous determination rule reduce some delay tactics.

**Strategic Abuse Pattern**:
- Used as "stop number one" when agencies don't want to release records
- Requests for clarification often themselves unclear or overly broad
- Creates indefinite delay without violating letter of the law

### Attorney General Review Process - AMENDED BY HB 4219

**NEW RESTRICTIONS (Section 552.301 - Amended 2025)**:

A governmental body **may not** request an AG decision if the AG has previously issued a written decision concluding that identical or substantially identical information is excepted from required disclosure, **unless**:
1. The previous decision has been overruled by a court of competent jurisdiction
2. The information involves different factual circumstances
3. There has been a change in applicable law since the previous decision

**NEW: Limited Scope for AG Requests**:
A governmental body may request an AG decision only for:
1. Novel questions of law not previously addressed
2. Information involving unique factual circumstances
3. Requests where competing exemptions create genuine legal uncertainty

**Enhanced Transparency Requirements (Section 552.302 - Amended 2025)**:
When submitting a request for AG decision, agencies must:
- Identify any previous AG rulings on similar information
- Explain why the current request presents novel legal issues
- Provide specific factual basis for claimed exemptions
- Demonstrate good faith efforts to release non-exempt portions

**Timeline**: Still no fixed deadline for AG opinion, but scope is now limited
**Effect**: Should reduce delays from repetitive AG appeals on settled issues

---

## Fee Structure (VERIFIED 2025)

### Fee Waiver Criteria
- **Public Interest**: Information primarily benefits public rather than requester

### Strategic Fee Barriers
1. **Excessive Estimates**: Inflate programming time projections
2. **Deposit Requirements**: Demand large upfront payments
3. **Scope Expansion**: Interpret requests broadly to increase fees
4. **Technical Complexity**: Claim simple requests require programming

---

## NEW: Expanded Presumptive Disclosure Categories (HB 4219)

- Must be provided in writing within 10 business days
- Applies when no responsive records exist

**Clarification Request Tactics (STILL IN USE)**:
- "Please clarify what specific documents you want"

### Phase 3: Financial Barriers

**Cost Estimate Phase**:
- Agency provides estimate (often inflated)
- May demand payment before work begins
- Can claim "programming" for routine database queries
- No appeal process for fee disputes

**Fee Challenge Strategies**:
- Request detailed breakdown of time estimates
- Challenge "programming" characterization for simple searches
- Demand justification for hourly rates charged
- Seek fee waiver based on public interest
- **NEW**: Reference expanded presumptive disclosure categories (may reduce fees)

### Phase 4: Attorney General Review - LIMITED BY HB 4219

**NEW RESTRICTIONS**: Can only request AG decision for:
- Novel questions of law not previously addressed
- Unique factual circumstances
- Genuine legal uncertainty from competing exemptions

**When It Occurs**: Agency claims exemption applies
**Timeline**: No fixed deadline for AG opinion
**Effect**: Should be reduced under HB 4219 limitations
**Outcome**: Opinion becomes public record and precedent

**NEW: Enhanced Submission Requirements**:
Agency must identify previous AG rulings and explain why request presents novel issues

### Phase 5: Record Production or Final Denial

**Upon AG Opinion**: Agency must follow AG determination
**Production Standards**: Must provide records in requested format when possible

### The Texas "Clarification Games" 🎯
**Barrier**: Vague clarification requests to pause deadlines (STILL AVAILABLE UNDER HB 4219)

**Response Strategies**:
1. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of all requests and responses
2. **Push Back Immediately**: Challenge unreasonable clarification requests in writing
3. **Provide Minimal Changes**: Give shortest possible response that addresses request
4. **Set Deadlines**: Request agency respond to clarification within specific timeframe
5. **Escalate Quickly**: Contact agency head if clarification requests are abusive
6. **NEW**: Cite HB 4219's enhanced penalties for bad faith delays

### Programming Fee Inflation 💰
**Barrier**: Claiming routine searches require expensive programming

**Response Strategies**:
1. **Challenge Characterization**: Argue request is routine database query
2. **Request Alternatives**: Ask for different format that avoids programming
3. **Compare Costs**: Reference similar requests fulfilled without programming
4. **Demand Justification**: Require detailed explanation of programming necessity
5. **NEW**: Reference expanded contracting and personnel disclosure categories

### Attorney General Review Delays ⏰ (REDUCED BY HB 4219)
**Barrier**: Agencies use AG review process to delay even clearly releasable records

**HB 4219 IMPROVEMENTS**:
- Agencies cannot request AG decisions on settled exemption questions
- Must cite previous AG rulings within 10 days
- Enhanced submission requirements increase transparency

**Response Strategies**:
1. **Challenge Exemption Claims**: File comments with AG opposing withholding
2. **Request Partial Release**: Ask for clearly releasable portions immediately
3. **Monitor AG Process**: Track opinion request through AG system
4. **PUBLIC** Pressure**: Media attention on excessive delays
5. **NEW**: Challenge improper AG requests under Section 552.301(a)
6. **NEW**: Cite previous AG rulings to preempt delay tactics

---

## Enforcement Strategies

### Administrative Options
1. **Agency Complaints**: Contact department head or city/county attorney
2. **Elected Official Pressure**: Contact legislators and other officials
3. **Public Attention**: Media coverage of delays and denials
4. **Professional Networks**: Bar associations and journalism groups
5. **NEW**: Open Records Hotline (Section 552.013)

### Judicial Enforcement

**NEW: Mandamus Action (Section 552.3235)**:
- Court Venue: District court in county where records located
- Legal Standard: Mandamus action to compel disclosure
- Attorney Fees: Available if requester "substantially prevails"
- Timeline: 6-12 months typical for resolution
- Costs: Can be significant but recoverable if successful
- **NEW**: Enhanced grounds for mandamus under HB 4219

### Strategic Litigation Considerations
- Texas has strong pro-disclosure presumption
- Courts generally skeptical of agency delay tactics
- Attorney fee recovery encourages legal action
- Precedential value helps future requesters
- **NEW**: HB 4219 strengthens requester position on improper delays

## 2025 Digital Records Clarifications (v0.11)

### Enhanced Coverage of Audio and Text Messaging Platforms

**Overview**
- **Source**: National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) Public Records Analysis
- **Reference**: [Public Records Law and State Legislatures](https://www.ncsl.org/center-for-legislative-strengthening/public-records-law-and-state-legislatures)
- **Nature**: Clarification and application guidance, not statutory amendment
- **Implementation**: Wisconsin DOJ updated compliance guidance in 2025
- **Context**: Addresses ambiguity about modern digital communication platforms

**"Digital Record" Definition Clarification**
- **Statutory Basis**: Existing Wis. Stat. § 19.32 definition of "record"
- **Clarified Coverage**:
  - Audio recordings created or used for government business
  - Text messaging platforms (SMS, Signal, WhatsApp, etc.)
  - Voice messaging and voicemail systems
  - Messaging features within other applications
  - Any platform used to conduct government business
- **Key Principle**: Format and platform do not determine record status
- **Determining Factor**: Content relates to government function or business
- **Implementation Note**: This clarifies existing law rather than creating new obligations

**Audio Communication Platform Coverage**
- **Scope**:
  - Recorded phone calls on government matters
  - Voicemail messages related to official business
  - Audio meeting recordings and transcripts
  - Podcast or audio broadcast content
  - Voice messages via apps or platforms
- **Retention Requirements**:
  - Same retention standards as written records
  - Must be preserved if subject to open records request
  - Cannot be automatically deleted if business-related
- **Access Standards**:
  - Must be made available in accessible format
  - Transcription may be provided if audio unavailable
  - Requester may specify preferred format
- **Best Practice**: Agencies should maintain clear policies for audio record retention

**Text Messaging Platform Coverage**
- **Included Platforms**:
  - SMS and MMS messaging on personal or government devices
  - Encrypted messaging apps (Signal, Telegram, etc.)
  - Workplace messaging (Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.)
  - Social media direct messaging
  - Any text-based communication on government business
- **Government Device vs. Personal Device**:
  - Records subject to law regardless of device ownership
  - Content determines record status, not device
  - Personal devices used for government business create public records
  - Agencies should have clear BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies
- **Retention Challenges**:
  - Ephemeral messaging features (auto-delete) problematic
  - Agencies must preserve responsive messages
  - Cannot use auto-delete for records subject to retention
- **Collection Requirements**:
  - Agencies must have systems to capture and preserve messages
  - Regular collection from personal devices if used for government business
  - Clear policies about acceptable platforms and preservation

**Implementation Guidance for Agencies**
- **Policy Development**:
  - Written policies on acceptable communication platforms
  - Clear retention schedules for audio and text records
  - Training for staff on preservation obligations
  - Systems for capturing communications from various platforms
- **Technology Solutions**:
  - Archiving systems that capture diverse platforms
  - Mobile device management for government devices

  - Regular audits of communication practices
- **Compliance Monitoring**:
  - Regular review of communication platform usage
  - Verification that retention policies are followed

  - Documentation of preservation efforts

**Practice Impact for Requesters**
- **Broader Scope**: Can request text messages and audio communications
- **Platform Specific**: Should specify platforms used (e.g., "Signal messages")
- **Time Periods**: Include specific date ranges to aid in retrieval
- **Format Preferences**: Request searchable text format when possible
- **Verification**: Can challenge claims that messages were not preserved
- **Personal Devices**: May request communications on personal devices if used for government business
- **Preservation Letters**: Send preservation notice early if litigation anticipated

**Strategic Considerations for Record Requests**
- **Request Language**: Explicitly include "text messages, audio recordings, and communications via any platform"
- **Platform Examples**: List specific platforms known to be used (Teams, Signal, etc.)
- **Device Coverage**: Specify "including personal devices used for government business"
- **Metadata**: Request metadata showing message timestamps and participants
- **Cross-Reference**: Request both text and audio communications on same subject
- **Early Action**: Submit requests promptly before auto-deletion occurs
- **Litigation Hold**: Send preservation letters for anticipated litigation

**Common Agency Challenges and Responses**
- **"Auto-Delete" Claims**: Challenge with preservation obligation arguments
- **"Personal Device" Objections**: Cite clarification that device doesn't determine record status
- **"Technically Difficult"**: Request specific explanation of technical barriers
- **"No System in Place"**: Agency lack of systems doesn't eliminate obligations
- **"Too Burdensome"**: May need to narrow scope but cannot use as blanket denial
- **"Privacy Concerns"**: Personal content can be redacted, business records still accessible

**Legal and Policy Context**
- **Existing Law Application**: Clarification applies existing statute to modern technology
- **No Statutory Change**: Wisconsin Legislature did not amend the Open Records Law
- **DOJ Guidance**: Wisconsin Department of Justice provided implementation guidance
- **National Trend**: Wisconsin aligns with broader movement toward digital record inclusion

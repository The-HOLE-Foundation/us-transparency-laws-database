## Remaining States - Templates Exist

### Template Status
All 5 remaining states have placeholder files at:
- `data/v0.12/rights/south-carolina-rights.json`
- `data/v0.12/rights/tennessee-rights.json`
- `data/v0.12/rights/virginia-rights.json`
- `data/v0.12/rights/kentucky-rights.json`
- `data/v0.12/rights/mississippi-rights.json`

**Current State**: UNVERIFIED TEMPLATES
- Placeholder citations (not real statutes)
- Generic descriptions
- `source_verified: false`
- `verification_status: "UNVERIFIED TEMPLATE"`

### What's Needed

**For Each State (15-18 rights per state)**:
1. Research official statutes from .gov sources
2. Replace template citations with real statutory references
3. Update descriptions with state-specific provisions
4. Verify all request tips are actionable
5. Change `source_verified: true`
6. Import to database

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours per state = 15-20 hours total

### Priority Recommendation

**Tier 1** (High Impact):
1. **Virginia** (8.7M, FOIA foundation state, strong laws)
2. **Tennessee** (7.0M, recent reforms)

**Tier 2** (Medium):
3. **South Carolina** (5.2M)
4. **Kentucky** (4.5M)

**Tier 3** (Lower priority):
5. **Mississippi** (2.9M, smaller population)

## Integration Status

### ‚úÖ FOIA Generator Ready

All 62 imported rights include:
- **assertion_language**: Ready-to-use request tips
- **statutory_citation**: Legal references
- **conditions**: Structured applicability notes
- **priority**: Critical/High/Medium for intelligent suggestions

Example assertion language (Louisiana):
> "Request records in digital format and cite La. R.S. 44:32: 'There shall be no cost to inspect or make digital copies of a public record during regular working hours.' Insist on free electronic delivery."

### ‚úÖ Database Performance

- Full-text search: Operational
- Vector embeddings: Schema ready (v0.13)
- Foreign keys: Valid
- Constraints: All passing
- Usage tracking: Initialized

## Impact Analysis

### Population Coverage

**Completed States**: 29M people (51% of Southeast region)
**Pending States**: 28M people (49% of Southeast region)

**National Coverage**:
- Southeast (Worker 2): 4/11 states (36%)
- Other regions: Varies by worker
- Overall: ~10% of 52 jurisdictions complete

### Legal Coverage

**Categories Covered** (all 4 states):

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Template Approach**: Federal rights provided excellent starting point
2. **Targeted Research**: RCFP guides + official statutes = efficient
3. **Category Consistency**: Same 7 categories across states
4. **Import Automation**: Production-ready script saved hours

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Source Access**: Some state sites block automated tools (403 errors)
2. **PDF Extraction**: Official documents often not machine-readable
3. **Template Discovery**: Found existing templates mid-process (duplication)
4. **Token Management**: Comprehensive documentation uses significant tokens

### Recommendations

1. **Check for Templates First**: Avoid duplicate work
2. **Batch Research**: Research all states before writing JSON
3. **Use RCFP Guides**: Excellent summaries, then verify statutes
4. **Streamline for Remaining States**: Focus on unique provisions

- State office closings are regulated by Michigan Department of Civil Service Regulation 5.08

## Special Notes

### Michigan-Specific Holidays
- **General Election Day**: Observed as a state holiday on "the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years" - This means Election Day is a paid holiday in years like 2026, but NOT in 2025
- **Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve**: Michigan is one of the few states that observes both December 24 and December 31 as paid state holidays

### Holiday Count
- Odd-numbered years (like 2025): 13 paid holidays
- Even-numbered years (like 2026): 14 paid holidays (includes General Election Day)

### Statutory Foundation
Public Act 124 of 1865 is the historic foundational law that established Michigan's legal holidays. This 160-year-old statute remains the basis for state holiday designations.

### Recent Additions
- **Juneteenth** (June 19): Added to Michigan's state holidays in recent years, aligning with the federal Juneteenth National Independence Day holiday

### Thanksgiving Period
Michigan observes both Thanksgiving Day (Thursday) and the Day after Thanksgiving (Friday) as paid holidays.

### Year-End Holidays
Michigan's year-end holiday schedule is particularly generous, with potential for 4 paid holidays in late December/early January:
- Christmas Eve (December 24)
- Christmas Day (December 25)
- New Year's Eve (December 31)
- New Year's Day (January 1)

### Civil Service Regulation
The Michigan Department of Civil Service Regulation 5.08 governs the specific dates of state office closings for these holidays, ensuring consistency across state agencies.

### Private Sector
Note: Private employers in Michigan are NOT required to close on these state holidays or provide paid time off. These holidays apply to state employees.

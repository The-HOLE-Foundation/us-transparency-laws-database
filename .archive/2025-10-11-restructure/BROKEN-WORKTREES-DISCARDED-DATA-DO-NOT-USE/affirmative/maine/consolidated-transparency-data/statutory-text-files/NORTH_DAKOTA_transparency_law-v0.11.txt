NORTH DAKOTA CENTURY CODE 44-04-18 - ACCESS TO PUBLIC RECORDS

ยง 44-04-17.1. Definitions.
As used in sections 44-04-17.1 through 44-04-21.1:
(16) "Record" means recorded information of any kind, regardless of the physical form or characteristic by which the information is stored, recorded, or reproduced, which is in the possession or custody of a public entity or its agent and which has been received or prepared for use in connection with public business or contains information relating to public business.

ยง 44-04-18. Access to public records - Electronically stored information.
1. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, all records of a public entity are public records, open and accessible for inspection during reasonable office hours. As used in this subsection, "reasonable office hours" includes all regular office hours of a public entity. If a public entity does not have regular office hours, the name and telephone number of a contact person authorized to provide access to the public entity's records must be posted on the door of the office of the public entity, if any.

2. Upon request for a copy of specific public records, any entity subject to subsection 1 shall furnish the requester one copy of the public records requested. An initial request need not be made in person or in writing, and the copy must be mailed upon request. A public entity may require written clarification of the request to determine what records are being requested, but may not ask for the motive or reason for requesting the records or for the identity of the person requesting public records.

3. Automation of public records must not erode the right of access to those records. As used in this section, "electronically stored information" means information stored in an electronic medium from which information can be obtained either directly or, if necessary, after translation by the responding party into a reasonably usable form. A public entity maintaining electronically stored information may provide the information in the electronic form in which the public entity maintains the information.

4. A public entity may impose a reasonable fee for making copies of public records. As used in this section, "reasonable fee" means the actual cost to the public entity of making the copy, including labor, materials, and equipment. A public entity may charge up to twenty-five cents per impression of a paper copy or the actual per-page cost of the copying or duplicating equipment, whichever amount is greater. An entity may impose a fee not exceeding twenty-five dollars per hour per request, excluding the initial hour, for locating records, including electronic records, if locating the records requires more than one hour. Before imposing the fee, the entity shall provide the requester with a written summary of the applicable fees. The entity may require a deposit not exceeding fifty percent of the estimated fee.

5. This section does not require a public entity to create a record that does not exist. A public entity is not required to compile information, perform legal research, provide legal advice, or create a legal analysis in response to a records request.

6. A disclosure of a requested record under this section is not a waiver of any copyright held by the public entity in the requested record or of any applicable evidentiary privilege.

ยง 44-04-18.1. Confidential records - When disclosure is prohibited or discretionary.
The following records of a public entity are confidential and disclosure is prohibited or discretionary as provided in this section:

1. Medical records;
2. Attorney-client privileged communications and attorney work product;
3. Records of an ongoing criminal investigation;
4. Records which if disclosed would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
5. Records the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law;

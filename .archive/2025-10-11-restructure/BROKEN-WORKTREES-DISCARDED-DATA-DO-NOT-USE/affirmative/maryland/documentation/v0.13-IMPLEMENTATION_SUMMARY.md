# v0.13 Vector Database - Implementation Summary

## What We Built

A production-ready **vector database system** using Supabase pgvector to power an AI agent specialized in FOIA request generation. This complements the existing structured tables (v0.11.1) by adding semantic search capabilities.

## Why This Matters

### The Problem
Your current structured database (v0.11.1) is **perfect for web UIs**:
- Great for maps, dropdowns, filters
- Perfect for displaying laws in tables
- Excellent for structured navigation

But **not optimal for AI agents**:
- AI needs to understand **meaning**, not just structure
- FOIA generation requires **contextual examples**
- Legal strategies need **semantic connections**

### The Solution
**Hybrid approach**: Structured tables + Vector embeddings

```
User Question: "How do I request fee waiver in California?"

Step 1: Search vector database for semantic matches
→ Finds documents about fee waivers, even if they use different words
→ Returns: "Financial hardship provisions", "Public interest criteria"

Step 2: Retrieve structured data for context
→ Gets California's exact fee structure from v0.11.1 tables
→ Gets response timelines, agency contacts

Step 3: AI combines both
→ Generates personalized FOIA request
→ Uses proven language from successful examples
→ Cites specific statutes and regulations
```

## What's in the Box

### 4 New Tables

1. **`foia_knowledge_documents`** - Curated high-yield content
   - Statute excerpts explaining key provisions
   - Exemption navigation strategies
   - Best practices and guidance
   - Case law summaries

2. **`foia_request_templates`** - Proven request templates
   - Templates with placeholders: `{{requester_name}}`
   - Success rate tracking
   - Example filled requests

3. **`foia_exemption_strategies`** - How to overcome exemptions
   - Links to your existing 365 exemptions
   - Strategies that have worked
   - Alternative approaches
   - Case law citations

4. **`foia_successful_examples`** - Real anonymized examples
   - What was requested
   - What was received
   - Challenges faced
   - How they were overcome

### Key Features

✅ **Hybrid Search**: Combines keyword + semantic search
✅ **Row-Level Security**: Fine-grained access control
✅ **ACID Compliance**: Vectors and data always in sync
✅ **Performance Optimized**: HNSW + GIN indexes
✅ **Cost Efficient**: ~$0.06 for all embeddings

## Technical Architecture

### Embedding Strategy

**Model**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions)

**Why?**
- Best balance of accuracy and cost
- Strong on legal/formal text
- $0.02 per 1M tokens (negligible cost)

### Search Function

`search_foia_knowledge(query_text, query_embedding, jurisdiction, limit)`

Uses **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** to combine:
- **Semantic search** (pgvector cosine similarity)
- **Keyword search** (PostgreSQL full-text search)

Result: Best of both worlds.

### Example Query

```typescript
// User asks: "How do I request fee waiver in California?"

const { data } = await supabase.rpc('search_foia_knowledge', {
  query_text: 'fee waiver California public interest',
  query_embedding: await openai.embeddings.create({
    input: 'fee waiver California',
    model: 'text-embedding-3-small'
  }),
  target_jurisdiction: 'california',
  limit_results: 5
})

// Returns top 5 most relevant documents
// AI agent uses them as context for generating the request
```

## Cost Analysis

### One-Time Embedding Generation

**Phase 1** (Federal + 10 priority states):
- 270 documents × 2000 tokens = 540,000 tokens
- Cost: **$0.01**

**Full Database** (52 jurisdictions):
- 1400 documents × 2000 tokens = 2,800,000 tokens
- Cost: **$0.06**

### Ongoing Costs

**Query embeddings**:
- 10,000 queries/month × 50 tokens = 500,000 tokens/month
- Cost: **$0.01/month**

**Storage**:
- 1400 vectors × 6KB = 8.4 MB
- Supabase free tier: 500MB ✅ (no cost)

**Total monthly cost**: ~$0.01 (negligible)

## Success Metrics

### How We'll Measure Success

1. **Retrieval Quality**
   - Target: >90% relevant documents in top 5 results
   - Measure: User feedback on result quality

2. **Generation Quality**
   - Target: >80% of requests "ready to send" without edits
   - Measure: Edit rate before submission

3. **Query Performance**
   - Target: <500ms for hybrid search
   - Measure: p95 response time

4. **User Satisfaction**
   - Target: NPS >50
   - Measure: Post-request surveys

## Data Curation Plan

### Phase 1: Priority Jurisdictions (Weeks 2-4)

**Federal** (highest impact):
- 10 statute text documents (one per key section)
- 9 exemption guidance docs (one per exemption)
- 10 request templates (basic, expedited, fee waiver, etc.)
- 5 best practices documents

**California** (second priority):
- 25 documents covering state-specific provisions

**9 Other Priority States** (NY, TX, FL, IL, WA, MA, OR, CT, NJ):
- 25 documents each = 225 total

**Phase 1 Total: ~270 documents**

### Document Quality Standards

Each document must include:
- ✅ Official citation to statute/regulation
- ✅ Clear, actionable guidance
- ✅ Use case tags for filtering
- ✅ Verification metadata (who verified, when)
- ✅ Confidence score (0.00-1.00)

### Example Document

```json
{
  "title": "Federal FOIA - Fee Waiver: Public Interest Standard",
  "document_type": "fee_waiver_guidance",
  "jurisdiction_slug": "federal",
  "content": "Under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), federal agencies must waive fees when disclosure is in the public interest because it is 'likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government' and is 'not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.'

To succeed with a fee waiver request, you must demonstrate:

1. **Public Interest Factors**:
   - The subject matter concerns government operations or activities
   - The disclosure will contribute to public understanding
   - The disclosure will contribute to understanding by the public (not just the requester)
   - The contribution to public understanding will be significant

2. **No Commercial Interest**:
   - You do not have a commercial interest in the disclosure
   - If you do have a commercial interest, the public interest outweighs it

**Proven Language**:
'This request seeks information about [agency operations/policy]. I am a [journalist/researcher/advocate] and will make this information available to the public through [publication/website/report]. The information will significantly contribute to public understanding of [specific government activity]. I have no commercial interest in this disclosure.'",

  "summary": "Explains the two-part test for federal fee waivers: public interest and no commercial interest",

  "key_points": {
    "public_interest_test": [
      "Subject concerns government operations",
      "Contributes to public understanding",
      "Significant contribution"
    ],
    "commercial_interest_test": [
      "No commercial interest, OR",
      "Public interest outweighs commercial interest"
    ]
  },

  "use_case_tags": ["fee_waiver", "cost_reduction", "public_interest", "journalist", "researcher"],
  "confidence_score": 1.00,
  "citation": "5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii)",
  "verified_by": "Project Lead",
  "verified_at": "2025-10-07T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Integration with FOIA Generator

### Current Flow (without vectors)

```
User describes request
  ↓
Select jurisdiction from dropdown
  ↓
Select agency from list
  ↓
AI generates generic request
  ↓
User edits extensively
  ↓
Submits request
```

### New Flow (with vectors)

```
User describes request: "I need EPA air quality data for my city"
  ↓
AI searches vector DB for relevant context:
  - EPA-specific tips
  - Environmental data request strategies
  - Successful EPA requests
  - Fee waiver language (data often qualifies)
  ↓
AI retrieves structured data from v0.11.1:
  - Federal FOIA response timeline
  - EPA contact information
  - Relevant exemptions to avoid triggering
  ↓
AI generates highly customized request:
  - Uses proven language from successful examples
  - Cites specific regulations
  - Includes fee waiver justification
  - Anticipates and addresses potential exemptions
  ↓
User makes minor edits (name, contact info)
  ↓
Submits high-quality request
```

### API Example

```typescript
async function generateFOIARequest(userDescription: string) {
  // Step 1: Identify jurisdiction and agency from description
  const jurisdiction = await identifyJurisdiction(userDescription)
  const agency = await identifyAgency(userDescription)

  // Step 2: Search vector DB for relevant context
  const queryEmbedding = await openai.embeddings.create({
    model: 'text-embedding-3-small',
    input: userDescription
  })

  const context = await supabase.rpc('search_foia_knowledge', {
    query_text: userDescription,
    query_embedding: queryEmbedding.data[0].embedding,
    target_jurisdiction: jurisdiction.slug,
    limit_results: 5
  })

  // Step 3: Get structured data
  const lawDetails = await supabase
    .from('transparency_laws')
    .select('*, response_requirements(*), exemptions(*)')
    .eq('jurisdiction_id', jurisdiction.id)
    .single()

  // Step 4: Build prompt for LLM
  const systemPrompt = `You are a FOIA expert. Generate a request using:

RELEVANT EXAMPLES AND STRATEGIES:
${context.data.map(doc => doc.content).join('\n\n')}

JURISDICTION DETAILS:
- Response deadline: ${lawDetails.response_requirements.standard_response_days} days
- Exemptions to avoid: ${lawDetails.exemptions.map(e => e.category).join(', ')}

USER REQUEST:
${userDescription}`

  // Step 5: Generate with context
  const request = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
      { role: 'user', content: 'Generate a FOIA request.' }
    ]
  })

  return request.choices[0].message.content
}
```

## Comparison: Structured vs Vector

| Feature | Structured Tables (v0.11.1) | Vector Database (v0.13) |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Display, navigation, filtering | Semantic search, AI context |
| **Query Type** | Exact matches, structured filters | Meaning-based, fuzzy matches |
| **Best For** | Web UIs, maps, dropdowns | AI agents, RAG, recommendations |
| **Example Query** | "Get all California exemptions" | "How to overcome privacy exemptions?" |
| **Response** | List of exemptions with IDs | Relevant strategies and examples |
| **Human-Readable** | ✅ Perfect | ⚠️ Embeddings are just numbers |
| **AI-Optimized** | ⚠️ Requires manual prompt engineering | ✅ Automatic semantic understanding |

## Key Insights from Research

### 1. Hybrid > Pure Vector

**Finding**: Combining keyword + semantic search outperforms either alone.

**Why**: Legal queries often include specific terms ("Exemption 5", "5 USC 552") that must match exactly, while also needing conceptual understanding.

### 2. PostgreSQL > Dedicated Vector DBs (for this use case)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ ACID compliance (vectors and data always in sync)
- ✅ Single database (no synchronization complexity)
- ✅ Proven at scale (pgvector handles millions of vectors)
- ✅ Built-in security (RLS)
- ✅ Zero learning curve (just PostgreSQL)

### 3. Curated > Comprehensive

**Finding**: 500 high-quality curated documents outperform 5000 raw documents.

**Strategy**:
- Focus on "high-yield" content
- Each document must teach the AI something useful
- Quality > Quantity

### 4. Row-Level Security is Critical

**Finding**: Legal documents often have access restrictions.

**Implication**: We need RLS so:
- Public documents are available to all
- User-submitted examples only visible to submitter (unless shared)
- Premium content restricted to paid users (future)

## Future Enhancements (v0.14+)

### 1. Multi-Modal Embeddings
Embed images of redacted documents to help AI recognize redaction patterns.

### 2. Conversation Memory
Store user's previous queries to provide personalized recommendations.

### 3. Feedback Loop
Track which suggestions users accept/reject to improve retrieval.

### 4. Community Knowledge
Allow users to contribute successful examples, with upvoting.

### 5. Real-Time Updates
Monitor for law changes and automatically re-embed updated documents.

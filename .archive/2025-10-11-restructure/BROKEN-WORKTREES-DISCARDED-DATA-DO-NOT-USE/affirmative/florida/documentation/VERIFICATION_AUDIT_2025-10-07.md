# CRITICAL VERIFICATION AUDIT REPORT

## Executive Summary

**AUDIT STATUS**: ⚠️ **CRITICAL ERROR FOUND - IMMEDIATE CORRECTION REQUIRED**

A comprehensive verification audit of Worker 2's Southeast regional rights data has revealed **1 critical error** requiring immediate correction before this data can serve as ground truth for AI training.

## Audit Scope

**States Audited**:
- Georgia (17 rights)
- Arkansas (15 rights)
- Louisiana (15 rights) ⚠️
- North Carolina (15 rights)

**Total Rights Audited**: 62 rights across 4 jurisdictions
**Verification Method**: Cross-reference against official .gov statutes and authoritative legal sources

## Critical Error Identified

### ❌ LOUISIANA: False Claim About Free Digital Copies

**Location**: `rights_of_access` table, Louisiana jurisdiction
**Right Name**: "Enhanced Access Rights: Free Inspection and Digital Copies"
**Claim Made**: "There is no cost to inspect public records or make digital copies during regular working hours. Custodians cannot charge for inspection or for digital/electronic copies."

**Statutory Citation Provided**: La. R.S. 44:32

**VERIFICATION FINDING**:
The claim is **PARTIALLY FALSE**. Official sources confirm:

✅ **TRUE**: No cost to INSPECT public records (La. R.S. 44:32)
❌ **FALSE**: Digital copies are NOT free

**Actual Statute Language** (from multiple verified sources):
- "There is no cost to inspecting or making digital copies of a public record during regular working hours" - This phrasing is ambiguous/misleading
- More accurate: "No cost for INSPECTION" + "Records maintained on computer systems should be provided by electronic means where possible at **no additional cost**"
- The "no additional cost" means no extra transmission fee for email delivery, NOT that digital copies are completely free
- **State agencies charge uniform fee** determined by Commissioner of Administration (recommended 25¢/page)
- Custodians may charge reasonable fees for digital copies

**Impact**: This error could lead requesters to believe they can get free digital copies in Louisiana, which is false. They can inspect for free, but copies (including digital) may incur fees.

**Required Correction**:
1. Update right description to accurately state: "No cost to INSPECT" (accurate)
2. Change digital copies claim to: "Electronic delivery available with no additional transmission fee when records are maintained electronically"
3. Add separate right for fee structure clarifying copying costs

## Required Corrections

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Louisiana - Right #3: "Free Inspection and Digital Copies"**

```json
{
  "category": "Enhanced Access Rights",
  "subcategory": "Free Inspection and Digital Copies",
  "statute_citation": "La. R.S. 44:32",
  "description": "There is no cost to inspect public records or make digital copies during regular working hours. Custodians cannot charge for inspection or for digital/electronic copies.",
  "request_tips": "Request records in digital format and cite La. R.S. 44:32: 'There shall be no cost to inspect or make digital copies of a public record during regular working hours.' Insist on free electronic delivery."
}
```

**CORRECTED VERSION**:
```json
{
  "category": "Enhanced Access Rights",
  "subcategory": "Free Inspection",
  "statute_citation": "La. R.S. 44:32",
  "description": "There is no cost to inspect public records during regular working hours. Inspection allows requesters to review records before deciding which to copy, avoiding unnecessary copying fees.",
  "conditions": "Applies during regular business hours",
  "applies_to": "All requesters",
  "implementation_notes": "Inspection is completely free. However, copies (including digital copies) may incur fees as determined by the custodian or Commissioner of Administration.",
  "request_tips": "Cite La. R.S. 44:32: 'There is no cost to inspect public records during regular working hours.' Use inspection to identify needed records before requesting copies to minimize fees."
}
```

**ADD NEW RIGHT** (separate from inspection):
```json
{
  "category": "Technology Rights",
  "subcategory": "No Additional Cost for Electronic Transmission",
  "statute_citation": "La. R.S. 44:32",
  "description": "Records maintained on computer systems should be provided by electronic means where possible at no additional cost. This means no extra transmission fee for email delivery, though standard copying fees still apply.",
  "conditions": "Applies when records are maintained electronically",
  "applies_to": "All requesters",
  "implementation_notes": "The 'no additional cost' provision means agencies cannot add a separate fee for electronic transmission (email, download). However, the base copying fee (typically 25¢/page equivalent) still applies per Commissioner of Administration guidance.",
  "request_tips": "Request: 'Please provide records electronically to avoid transmission fees. Per La. R.S. 44:32, electronic delivery should be at no additional cost beyond standard copying fees.'"
}
```

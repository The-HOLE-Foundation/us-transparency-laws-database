# ⚠️ QUARANTINED DATA - DO NOT USE ⚠️

## Why These Files Are Quarantined

These jurisdiction-data.json files were generated by autonomous AI agents during a bulk parsing operation. While they pass structural validation, they have NOT been manually verified for accuracy and contain concerning quality issues:

### Identified Problems:
1. **Missing source URLs** - Some files have `source_url: null`
2. **Generic citations** - Some exemptions cite entire chapters instead of specific sections
3. **Schema inconsistencies** - Some use different field structures than STANDARD_JURISDICTION_TEMPLATE
4. **Potentially inaccurate law names** - Not manually verified against official statutes
5. **Incomplete official_resources** - Many null fields that should be populated

### Critical Principle Violated:
**This database serves as ground truth for AI training and legal information.**
**100% accuracy is MANDATORY.**
**Agent-generated legal data without manual verification is UNACCEPTABLE.**

## Files Quarantined (40 states):

Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming

Plus 5 states from earlier work that need re-verification:
Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Illinois

## Safe Files (NOT Quarantined):

These 7 states were manually parsed and verified with high confidence:
1. ✅ Federal - Freedom of Information Act
2. ✅ California - California Public Records Act
3. ✅ Texas - Texas Public Information Act
4. ✅ New York - Freedom of Information Law
5. ✅ Pennsylvania - Right-to-Know Law
6. ✅ Ohio - Ohio Public Records Act (verify manually before use)
7. ✅ Georgia - Georgia Open Records Act (verify manually before use)
8. ✅ North Carolina - North Carolina Public Records Law (verify manually before use)
9. ✅ Michigan - Michigan Freedom of Information Act (verify manually before use)
10. ✅ Virginia - Virginia Freedom of Information Act (verify manually before use)
11. ✅ Washington - Washington Public Records Act (verify manually before use)
12. ✅ Massachusetts - Massachusetts Public Records Law (verify manually before use)

**NOTE**: Even the "Priority 1" states (OH, GA, NC, MI, VA, WA, MA) should be spot-checked manually before production use.

## Next Steps

1. **Reset quarantined states to empty templates**
2. **Manually parse each state from statutory text files**
3. **Verify every field against official statute**
4. **Cross-reference with official .gov sources**
5. **Only mark confidence: "high" after thorough manual review**

## Estimated Time to Complete Properly

- **40 states × 25 minutes average** = ~16-18 hours of careful manual work
- **No shortcuts, no automation for legal data**

## Lesson Learned

**DO NOT use AI agents to bulk-generate legal ground truth data.**

Even with validation scripts, subtle inaccuracies creep in:
- Wrong official law names
- Generic instead of specific citations
- Missing URLs to official sources
- Schema inconsistencies
- Unverified exemption descriptions

**Manual verification is the ONLY acceptable approach for legal ground truth.**

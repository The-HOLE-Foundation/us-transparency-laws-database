## Special Notes

### Annual Designation Process
Unlike many states with statutory holiday schedules, Georgia's holidays are designated annually by the sitting Governor through executive memorandum.

### Holiday Count
Full-time state employees are eligible for 13 paid holidays annually.

### Good Friday
Georgia is one of the states that observes Good Friday as an official paid state holiday.

### Unique 2025 Observation
According to the 2025 memo, Washington's Birthday is observed on Monday, February 17, with an additional observation on Friday, December 26, providing extended holiday coverage.

### Capitol and State Agency Closures
The holiday schedule determines when the Georgia State Capitol and state agencies will be closed.

### Legislative Authority
While the Governor designates the specific dates, the practice of providing 13 paid holidays per year to state employees is established by state policy and personnel regulations.

### Juneteenth Addition
Georgia added Juneteenth (June 19) to its official state holiday schedule, aligning with the federal Juneteenth National Independence Day holiday.

### Advance Notice
Holiday schedules are typically announced several months in advance (e.g., the 2025 schedule was announced in August 2024) to allow for planning.

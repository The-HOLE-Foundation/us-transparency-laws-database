<div class="div0"><font class="font0">&sect; 38-2-1. Purpose.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">The public's right to access to public records and the individual's right to dignity and privacy are both recognized to be principles of the utmost importance in a free society. The purpose of this chapter is to facilitate public access to public records. It is also the intent of this chapter to protect from disclosure information about particular individuals maintained in the files of public bodies when disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">&sect; 38-2-2. Definitions.
</font></div>

</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(a) Except as provided in &sect; 38-2-2(4), all records maintained or kept on file by any public body, whether or not those records are required by any law or by any rule or regulation, shall be public records and every person or entity shall have the right to inspect and/or copy those records at such reasonable time as may be determined by the custodian thereof.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(b) Any reasonably segregable portion of a public record excluded by &sect; 38-2-2(4) shall be available for public inspection after the deletion of the information which is the basis of the exclusion. If an entire document or record is deemed non-public, the public body shall state in writing that no portion of the document or record contains reasonable segregable information that is releasable.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(c) Each public body shall make, keep, and maintain written or recorded minutes of all meetings.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(d) Each public body shall adopt written procedures regarding public access to its public records. These procedures must include, but need not be limited to, the identification of a designated public records officer or unit, how to make a public records request, and where a public record request should be made, and a copy of these procedures shall be posted on the public body's website if such a website is maintained and be made otherwise readily available to the public.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(e) A written request for public records need not be made on a form established by a public body if the request is otherwise readily identifiable as a request for public records.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(f) A public body receiving a request shall permit the inspection or copying within ten (10) business days after receiving a request. If the inspection or copying is not permitted within ten (10) business days, the public body shall forthwith explain in writing the need for additional time to comply with the request.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(g) In such cases the public body may have up to an additional twenty (20) business days to comply with the request if it can demonstrate that the voluminous nature of the request, the number of requests for records pending, or the difficulty in searching for and retrieving or copying the requested records, is such that additional time is necessary to avoid imposing an undue burden on the public body.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(h) If a public record is in active use or in storage and, therefore, not available at the time a person or entity requests access, the custodian shall so inform the person or entity and make an appointment for the person or entity to examine such records as expeditiously as they may be made available.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(i) At the election of the person or entity requesting the public records, the public body shall provide copies of the public records electronically, by facsimile, or by mail in accordance with the requesting person or entity's choice, unless complying with that preference would be unduly burdensome due to the volume of records requested or the costs that would be incurred. The person requesting delivery shall be responsible for the actual cost of delivery, if any.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(j) No public body shall require a statement of purpose as a condition for making requests for public records available nor shall the public body withhold public records from disclosure because of the intended purpose of making the request.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">&sect; 38-2-4. Copying costs and search fees.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(a) The public body may charge a fee for copies that shall not exceed fifteen cents ($.15) per page.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(b) If complying with a request for inspection or copying requires more than one (1) hour of search or retrieval time, the public body may charge for the personnel costs associated with the time required, which shall be based upon the lowest paid employee capable of performing the task. The charge shall not exceed fifteen dollars ($15.00) per hour and shall not include the first hour of search time.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">&sect; 38-2-5. Enforcement and remedies.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">Any person denied access to records may apply to the superior court for a writ of mandamus to compel compliance with the provisions of this chapter. If the court determines that the public body has arbitrarily or capriciously denied access to the records, the court may impose a civil fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">&sect; 38-2-8. Complaints to the Attorney General.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(a) Any person denied access to a public record by a public body may file a complaint with the attorney general on forms to be provided by the attorney general.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(b) The attorney general is charged with investigating any complaint brought by a private citizen related to access to public records. Upon determining that there has been an unlawful denial of access to public records, the attorney general may institute proceedings in the superior court to compel access to public records.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">&sect; 38-2-9. Superior court jurisdiction.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">The superior court shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus ordering the disclosure of records improperly withheld from any person, regardless of where the public body is located within the state.

## Archive Status

**Archive Date**: 2025-09-29
**Reason**: Phase 1 (Statute Validation) and initial organization planning complete
**Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Supabase Deployment

## Archived Documents

## Historical Context

These planning documents were created during the project's critical validation phase when:
- Statute accuracy was uncertain (v0.10 was outdated)
- File organization needed standardization
- 2025 legislative amendments needed identification
- Database structure was still being designed

All goals from these planning documents have been achieved, and the project has moved into the Supabase deployment phase.

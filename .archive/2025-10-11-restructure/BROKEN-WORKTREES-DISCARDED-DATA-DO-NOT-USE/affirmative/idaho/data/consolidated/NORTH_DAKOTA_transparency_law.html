An initial request need not be made in person or in writing, and the copy must be mailed upon request. A public entity may require written clarification of the request to determine what records are being requested, but may not ask for the motive or reason for requesting the records or for the identity of the person requesting public records.

An entity may impose a fee not exceeding twenty-five dollars per hour per request, excluding the initial hour, for locating records, including electronic records, if locating the records requires more than one hour. Before imposing the fee, the entity shall provide the requester with a written summary of the applicable fees. The entity may require a deposit not exceeding fifty percent of the estimated fee.

## Data Collection Protocol

### Step 1: Official Source Verification
For each state, verify the official government source:
```bash
# Template verification checklist
- [ ] URL ends in .gov or official legislature domain
- [ ] Statute text is current (check "last amended" date)
- [ ] Full text available (not summary or commentary)
- [ ] PDF or HTML format (official publication)
```

### Step 2: Rights Identification
Extract rights following federal model structure:

**Categories to identify**:
1. **Proactive Disclosure Rights**
   - Agency obligations to publish without request
   - Public meeting requirements
   - Automatic disclosure provisions

2. **Technology Rights**
   - Electronic format preferences
   - Database access rights
   - Online portal requirements

3. **Enhanced Access Rights**
   - Expedited processing criteria
   - Fee waiver provisions
   - In-person inspection rights

4. **Requester-Specific Rights**
   - Journalist privileges
   - Researcher access
   - Commercial requester provisions

5. **Timeliness Rights**
   - Response deadlines
   - Deemed granted provisions
   - Extension limitations

6. **Inspection Rights**
   - On-site review provisions
   - Copying at agency
   - Redaction review process

### Step 3: JSON Structure
Follow federal template exactly:
```json
{
  "jurisdiction": {
    "slug": "massachusetts",
    "name": "Massachusetts"
  },
  "rights_of_access": [
    {
      "category": "Proactive Disclosure",
      "subcategory": "Public Meeting Materials",
      "statute_citation": "M.G.L. c. 66 § 10",
      "description": "[Exact statutory language or accurate summary]",
      "conditions": "[When this right applies]",
      "applies_to": "[Who can exercise this right]",
      "implementation_notes": "[How agencies implement this]",
      "request_tips": "[Language to use in requests]"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Quality Validation
Before committing each state:
```bash
# Validation checklist
- [ ] All citations verified from official source
- [ ] Descriptions accurate to statute language
- [ ] Request tips are actionable and specific
- [ ] Implementation notes reflect current practice
- [ ] JSON validates against schema
- [ ] File saved to: data/v0.12/rights/{state-slug}-rights.json
```

## Expected Output Per State

### Minimum Viable Rights Document
Each state should have **5-10 rights** covering:

**Must Have (5 rights minimum)**:
1. At least 1 Proactive Disclosure right
2. At least 1 Technology/Format right
3. At least 1 Fee Waiver/Cost right
4. At least 1 Timeliness right
5. At least 1 Inspection/Access right

**Should Have (8 rights target)**:
- 2-3 Proactive Disclosure rights
- 1-2 Technology rights
- 1-2 Enhanced Access rights (expedited, fee waiver)
- 1-2 Requester-Specific rights
- 1-2 Timeliness rights

**Excellence (10+ rights)**:
- Comprehensive coverage of all 6 categories
- State-specific innovations
- Comparison with federal baseline
- Cross-references to related provisions

## Regional Patterns to Document

As the Northeast specialist, identify regional patterns:

### Legal Traditions
- New England cluster (MA, CT, RI, VT, NH, ME): Common legal heritage
- Mid-Atlantic (NY, NJ, PA, DE): More administrative law influence
- DC: Unique federal/local hybrid

### Innovation Areas
- Technology mandates (likely strongest in MA, NJ)
- Fee waiver provisions (track generosity)
- Expedited processing (compare standards)
- FOI commission oversight (CT has strong model)

### Comparative Advantage
Document where Northeast states exceed federal baseline:
- Stronger proactive disclosure?
- Better technology rights?
- More generous fee waivers?
- Faster response times?

## Quality Assurance

### Self-Review Checklist
Before marking state complete:
- [ ] All sources are official .gov sites
- [ ] Citations match current statute text
- [ ] Request tips are tested language
- [ ] Implementation notes reflect reality
- [ ] JSON structure matches federal template
- [ ] File naming: `{state-slug}-rights.json`
- [ ] Committed to: `data/v0.12/rights/`

### Cross-Worker Coordination
Share regional insights:
- Document unique Northeast innovations
- Flag states with exceptional provisions
- Note gaps compared to other regions

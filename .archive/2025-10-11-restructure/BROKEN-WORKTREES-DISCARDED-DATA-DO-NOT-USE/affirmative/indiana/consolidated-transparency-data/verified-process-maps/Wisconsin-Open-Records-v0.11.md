  - Messaging features within other applications
  - Any platform used to conduct government business

  - Personal devices used for government business create public records
  - Agencies should have clear BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies
- **Retention Challenges**:
  - Ephemeral messaging features (auto-delete) problematic
  - Agencies must preserve responsive messages
  - Cannot use auto-delete for records subject to retention
- **Collection Requirements**:
  - Agencies must have systems to capture and preserve messages

  - Clear policies about acceptable platforms and preservation

**Implementation Guidance for Agencies**

- **Early Action**: Submit requests promptly before auto-deletion occurs
- **Litigation Hold**: Send preservation letters for anticipated litigation

- **"Technically Difficult"**: Request specific explanation of technical barriers
- **"No System in Place"**: Agency lack of systems doesn't eliminate obligations
- **"Too Burdensome"**: May need to narrow scope but cannot use as blanket denial
- **"Privacy Concerns"**: Personal content can be redacted, business records still accessible

**Legal and Policy Context**
- **Existing Law Application**: Clarification applies existing statute to modern technology

<div class="div0"><font class="font0">SECTION 50-18-70. LEGISLATIVE INTENT; DEFINITIONS
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(a) The General Assembly finds and declares that the strong public policy of this state is in favor of open government; that open government is essential to a free, open, and democratic society; and that public access to public records should be encouraged to foster confidence in government and so that the public can evaluate the expenditure of public funds and the efficient and proper functioning of its institutions. The General Assembly further finds and declares that there is a strong presumption that public records should be made available for public inspection without delay.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(b) This article shall be broadly construed to allow the inspection of governmental records. The exceptions set forth in this article, together with any other exception located elsewhere in the Code, shall be interpreted narrowly to exclude only those portions of records addressed by such exception.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(c) As used in this article, the term:
</font></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(1) &quot;Agency&quot; means every state department, agency, board, bureau, commission, and authority; every county, municipal corporation, school district, or other political subdivision of the state; every department, agency, board, bureau, commission, authority, or similar body of each such county, municipal corporation, school district, or other political subdivision of the state; every city, county, regional, or other authority established pursuant to the laws of this state; and any nonprofit organization to which there is a direct allocation of tax funds made by the governing body of any agency as defined in this paragraph, including any contractor or private entity which by agreement with an agency obtains ownership of records which would otherwise be subject to this article, provided, however, that a nonprofit organization shall be subject to this article only with regard to such tax funds.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(2) &quot;Public record&quot; means all documents, papers, letters, maps, books, tapes, photographs, computer based or generated information, data, data fields, or similar material prepared and maintained or received in the course of the operation of a public office or agency. The term &quot;public record&quot; shall also mean those portions of records containing information compiled by an agency which contain the names of law enforcement personnel when such portions are disclosed separately from the rest of the record; provided, however, that such agency shall be responsible for redacting information which otherwise would be confidential under this article or other provisions of law.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">SECTION 50-18-71. RIGHT OF ACCESS; TIMING; FEES; DENIAL OF REQUESTS; IMPACT OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(a) All public records of an agency as defined in subsection (a) of Code Section 50-18-70, except those which by order of a court of this state or by law are prohibited from being open to inspection by the general public, shall be open for a personal inspection by any citizen of this state at a reasonable time and place; and those in charge of such records shall not refuse this privilege to any citizen.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(b)(1) Any person may request access to a public record by submitting a request, orally or in writing, to the agency or to the individual who has custody of the record. An agency or custodian of a public record shall not be required to create new records or to compile, cross-reference, or reorganize existing records. The individual in control of such public record or records shall have a reasonable amount of time to determine whether or not the record or records requested are subject to access under this article and to permit inspection and copying. In no event shall this time exceed three business days; provided, however, that if the requester makes both an oral and a written request for the same records, the written request shall control and the three-business-day time period shall commence on the day the written request is received.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(c) The individual or agency who has custody of public records may establish a reasonable charge for research, retrieval, redaction, and other administrative costs associated with complying with a request for records. Such charge shall not exceed the prorated hourly salary rate of the lowest paid full-time employee who, in the discretion of the custodian of the records, has the necessary skill and training to perform the request; provided, however, that no charge shall be imposed for the first quarter hour. In addition to such costs, a reasonable charge for the copying or printing of records may be imposed which shall not exceed 10 cents per page for copies of 8&frac12; by 14 inches or smaller and the actual cost of reproduction for copies larger than 8&frac12; by 14 inches. For production on electronic media, the custodian may charge the actual cost of the electronic media on which the records or data are produced. If the estimated cost of production will be more than $25.00, the agency shall notify the requester within three business days and may defer production until the requester agrees to pay the estimated cost unless the requester indicated a willingness to pay $25.00 or more in the initial request. If the estimated cost of production will be more than $500.00, the agency may require a deposit of up to 50 percent of the estimated cost prior to beginning to search for, retrieve, redact, copy, or otherwise produce the requested records.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(d) In any instance in which an agency is required to or has decided to withhold all or part of a requested record, the agency shall notify the requester of the specific legal authority exempting the requested record or records from disclosure by Code section, subsection, and paragraph within a reasonable amount of time not to exceed three business days.
</font></div>
<div class="div0"> &nbsp;<br/></div>
<div class="div0"><font class="font0">(e) As provided in this subsection, an agency's use of electronic record keeping systems must not erode the public's right of access to records under this article. Agencies shall produce electronic copies of or, if the requester prefers, printouts of electronic records or data from data base fields that the agency maintains using the computer programs that the agency has in its possession.

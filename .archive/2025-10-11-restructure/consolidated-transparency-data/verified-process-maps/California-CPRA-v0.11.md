## Common Agency Tactics and Workarounds

- Request expedited processing for urgent matters
- **NEW**: Challenge improper cyberattack extension claims

### NEW: Cyberattack Extension Abuse (AB 370 Consideration)

**Prevention Strategies**:
- Request detailed documentation of cyberattack impact
- Demand proof of affected systems' relationship to requested records

### Overbroad Fee Estimates
**Problem**: Agencies inflate duplication costs

**Workaround**:

**Workaround**:

### "No Records Exist" Claims
**Problem**: Agencies claim no responsive records

**Workaround**:

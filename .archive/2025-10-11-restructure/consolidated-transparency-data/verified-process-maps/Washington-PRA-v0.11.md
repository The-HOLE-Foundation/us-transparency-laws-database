## Legal Framework

### Primary Statute
- **Public Records Act (PRA)**: RCW 42.56 et seq.
- **Original Enactment**: 1972 (Initiative 276)
- **Major Revision**: 2005 (comprehensive recodification)
- **Recent Updates**:
  - 2023 (SB 5432 - electronic records and fee structures)
  - **2025 (July 27 - workplace investigation voice alteration requirements)**

### Key Definitions (RCW 42.56.010)
- **Public Record**: Any writing containing information relating to agency business
- **Writing**: Electronic records, emails, texts, databases, and traditional documents
- **Agency**: State agencies, local governments, special purpose districts
- **Public Interest**: Benefit to general public in disclosure

### Legislative Intent (RCW 42.56.030)
The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may maintain control over the instruments that they have created.

### Constitutional Foundation
- **Article I, Section 5**: Washington Constitution - right of petition
- **Strong Presumption**: All records presumed public unless specifically exempt
- **Liberal Construction**: PRA interpreted to favor disclosure

## Common Agency Tactics and Workarounds

### Excessive Processing Delays
**Problem**: Agencies claiming "voluminous" for routine requests

**Workaround**:
- Request specific timeline and regular updates
- Offer to narrow scope or accept partial production
- Document unreasonable delays for potential litigation

### Improper Fee Estimates
**Problem**: High costs for electronic records or simple copying

**Workaround**:
- Challenge fee calculation methodology
- Request electronic format to avoid copying charges
- Cite 2023 fee limitation amendments

### Over-Broad Exemption Claims
**Problem**: Entire documents withheld without segregability analysis

**Workaround**:
- Demand line-by-line exemption justification
- Request in-camera judicial review
- Challenge categorical exemption applications

**NEW: Workplace Investigation Requests (2025)**
**Issue**: Agencies may over-apply voice alteration exemption

**Best Practices**:
- Request transcripts as alternative to audio recordings
- Challenge voice alteration necessity for non-witness recordings
- Request final investigation reports (not covered by voice alteration requirement)
- Seek disciplinary outcomes separately (presumptively public)

### Inadequate Searches
**Problem**: Agencies claiming "no records" without thorough search

**Workaround**:
- Provide specific evidence records should exist
- Request search methodology details
- Suggest additional search terms or locations

**Mandamus Actions:**
- **Requirements**: Clear duty to disclose, no adequate remedy
- **Burden**: Agency must justify withholding
- **Standard**: Abuse of discretion review

**Entitlement Standards:**
- Requester substantially prevailed
- Records obtained through litigation
- Agency denial not substantially justified

**Fee Calculation:**
- Reasonable hourly rates for qualified counsel

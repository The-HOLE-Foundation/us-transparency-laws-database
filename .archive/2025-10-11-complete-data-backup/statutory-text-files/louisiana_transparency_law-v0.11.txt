POLICY DECLARATION
==================
The Louisiana Public Records Act establishes that public records are presumed open unless specifically exempted by law. The statute must be "construed liberally, and any doubt must be resolved in favor of the right of access." Consistent with this policy, courts have held that exemptions must be strictly construed.

DEFINITION OF PUBLIC RECORDS (La. R.S. 44:1)
===========================================
"Public records" means: "All books, records, writings, accounts, letters and letter books, maps, drawings, photographs, cards, tapes, recordings, memoranda, and papers, and all copies, duplicates, photographs, including microfilm, or other reproductions thereof, or any other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, including information contained in electronic data processing equipment, having been used, being in use, or prepared, possessed, or retained for use in the conduct, transaction, or performance of any business, transaction, work, duty, or function which was conducted, transacted, or performed by or under the authority of the constitution or laws of this state..."

Modern Scope:
- Includes electronically stored information
- Covers information contained in databases or electronic data processing equipment
- "Regardless of physical form or characteristics"
- Broadly defined to encompass all government activities

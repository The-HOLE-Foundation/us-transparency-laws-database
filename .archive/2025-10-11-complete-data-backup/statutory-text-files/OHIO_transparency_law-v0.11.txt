"Public record" means records kept by any public office, including, but not limited to, state, county, city, village, township, and school district units, and records pertaining to the delivery of educational services by an alternative school in this state kept by the nonprofit or for-profit entity operating the alternative school pursuant to section 3313.533 of the Revised Code. "Public record" does not mean any of the following:

[Extensive list of 31+ exemptions including:]
(a) Medical records
(b) Records pertaining to probation and parole proceedings or to proceedings related to the commitment of a person as a sexually violent predator
(c) Records pertaining to actions under section 2151.85 and division (C) of section 2919.121 of the Revised Code and to appeals of actions arising under those sections
(d) Records pertaining to adoption proceedings, including the contents of an adoption file
(e) Information in a record contained in the putative father registry established by section 3107.062 of the Revised Code
[Multiple additional exemptions continue through subsection (dd)]

(2) Upon request and subject to division (B)(8) of this section, all public records responsive to the request shall be promptly prepared and made available for inspection to any person at all reasonable times during regular business hours. Subject to division (B)(8) of this section, upon request by any person, a public office or person responsible for public records shall make copies of the requested public record available at cost, within a reasonable period of time.

(B)(1) In order to facilitate broader access to public records, a public office or the person responsible for public records shall organize and maintain public records in a manner that they can be made available for inspection or copying in accordance with division (B) of this section.

(2) To facilitate broader access to public records, a public office shall have available a copy of its current records retention and disposal schedule at a location readily available to the public. If a requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has difficulty in making a request for copies or inspection of public records under this section, the public office or the person responsible for public records shall inform the requester of the manner in which records are maintained by the public office and accessed in the ordinary course of the public office's or person's duties and shall provide assistance to the requester in revising the request so that the request can be made in a manner that facilitates obtaining the public records sought.

(3) If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in whole, the public office or the person responsible for public records shall provide the requester with an explanation, including legal authority, for the denial.

(4) Unless specifically required by state or federal law or in accordance with division (B) of this section, no public office or person responsible for public records may limit or condition the availability of public records by requiring disclosure of the identity or intended use of any person requesting access.

(5) A public office or person responsible for public records may ask a requester to make the request in writing, may ask for the requester's identity, and may inquire about the intended use of the information requested, but may do so only after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not mandatory and that the requester is not required to reveal the requester's identity or the intended use and when a written request or disclosure of the identity or intended use would benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public office or person responsible for public records to identify, locate, or deliver the public records sought by the requester.

(6) Any denial of public records requested under this division shall be accompanied by an explanation, including legal authority, as set forth in division (B)(3) of this section.

(7) Upon any request made in accordance with division (B) of this section, a public office or person responsible for public records shall respond by acknowledging receipt of the request prior to any other response. The acknowledgment shall be made within one business day of receiving the request. If the request is clearly for existing public records within the custody or control of the public office, the public office shall produce the records for inspection or state its grounds for denial of the request, in accordance with division (B) of this section, within a reasonable period of time but not more than the number of business days stated in the public office's policy adopted under division (E)(2) of this section.

(8)(a) If the person making the public records request asks the public office to deliver the copy by United States mail or by another delivery service, the public office may require the person to pay in advance the cost of postage if the copy is delivered by United States mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is delivered by another delivery service.

(C)(1) If a person allegedly is aggrieved by the failure of a public office or the person responsible for public records to promptly prepare a public record for inspection in accordance with division (B) of this section, the person allegedly aggrieved may commence a mandamus action to obtain a judgment that orders the public office or the person responsible for the public record to comply with division (B) of this section, that awards court costs and reasonable attorney's fees to the person that instituted the mandamus action, and, if applicable, that includes an order fixing statutory damages under division (C)(2) of this section. The mandamus action may be commenced in the court of common pleas of the county in which division (B) of this section allegedly was not complied with, in the supreme court pursuant to its original jurisdiction under Section 2 of Article IV, Ohio Constitution, or in the court of appeals for the appellate district in which division (B) of this section allegedly was not complied with pursuant to its original jurisdiction under Section 3 of Article IV, Ohio Constitution.

(2) If a requester transmits a written request by hand delivery, electronic submission, or certified mail to inspect or receive copies of any public record in a manner that fairly describes the public record or class of public records to the public office or person responsible for the requested public records, and if the requester specifically requests damages under this division in the written request, then the requester shall be entitled to recover the amount of statutory damages set forth in this division if a court determines that the public office or the person responsible for public records failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division (B) of this section.

The amount of statutory damages shall be fixed at one hundred dollars for each business day during which the public office or person responsible for the requested public records failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division (B) of this section, beginning with the day on which the requester files a mandamus action to recover statutory damages, up to a maximum of one thousand dollars.

(D) Chapter 1347 of the Revised Code does not limit the provisions of this section.

(E)(1) To ensure that all employees of public offices are appropriately educated about a public office's obligations under division (B) of this section, all elected officials or their appropriate designees shall attend training on the requirements of this section and other applicable public records laws. All public offices shall adopt a public records policy in compliance with this section for responding to public records requests. In addition, all public offices shall adopt a public records policy in compliance with this section for responding to public records requests.

(2) The policy adopted under division (E)(1) of this section shall include a statement that the public office will not limit the number of public records requests that a person may make during a fixed period of time and that the public office will not limit the number of items within a single public records request, provided that the office may have different responses for different types of records, including expedited service for routine requests.

(F)(1) The bureau of workers' compensation may adopt rules pursuant to Chapter 119 of the Revised Code to reasonably limit the number of requests made by a person for records kept by the bureau under Title XLI of the Revised Code.

(2) As used in division (F)(1) of this section, "person" does not include journalists, as defined in section 2739.04 of the Revised Code, or legislators or their staff.

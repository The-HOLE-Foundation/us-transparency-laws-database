**Status:** ⏸️ PENDING - Need full subsection (a)(6)(E) text.

### ⚠️ RIGHT #5: Enhanced Access Rights - Fee Waiver (Public Interest)

**Citation:** 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii)

## PAUSE FOR STATUTE RETRIEVAL

To complete this rigorous validation, I need to retrieve the full text of:
- § 552(a)(6)(E) - Expedited processing
- § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) - Fee waiver public interest
- § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) - Fee waiver categories
- § 552(a)(6)(A)(i) - Response timelines
- § 552(a)(6)(C)(i) - Deemed exhausted
- § 552(a)(4)(E) - Attorney fees
- § 552(a)(4)(A)(iv)(I) - Electronic delivery fees
- § 552(a)(1) - Federal Register publications
- § 552(a)(8)(A)(ii)(III) - Segregability
- § 552(a)(6)(D) - Multitrack processing

**Decision Point:** Should I:
1. Continue fetching each subsection individually to complete validation?
2. Request access to full statutory text document?
3. Note which provisions need verification and complete validation later?

**Preliminary Assessment (First 3 Rights):**
- 3/3 verified portions PASS (100%)
- All citations accurate
- All descriptions match statute
- All qualify as true affirmative rights

**Estimated Remaining Work:** ~2 hours to verify all 15 rights line-by-line against statute.

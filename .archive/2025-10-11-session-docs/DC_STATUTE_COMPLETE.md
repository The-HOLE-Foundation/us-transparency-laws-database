**Future Plan** (from `FUTURE_TERRITORIAL_EXPANSION.md`):
- Keep DC as 'territory' for now (technically accurate)
- Functions as "51st state" programmatically
- Will reclassify with Puerto Rico, Guam, etc. in v0.13
- Comprehensive territorial expansion planned for Q1 2026

**No Action Needed**: DC classification as 'territory' is not causing any problems

2. ‚úÖ 2024 amendments documented
3. ‚úÖ File added to repository
4. ‚úÖ 52/52 statutory files now present

### üîÑ Remaining for DC (v0.12)

1. **Collect DC Rights of Access Data**
   - Extract affirmative rights from D.C. Code ¬ß 2-532
   - Create `data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/district-of-columbia-rights.json`
   - Verify each right against official statute
   - Import to Neon database

2. **DC Has 0 Rights in Database**
   - Current: 0 rights
   - Expected: ~15-20 rights (similar to other jurisdictions)
   - Use Federal rights as template
   - Verify from official DC statute

3. **Priority for Collection**
   - DC is technically the 52nd jurisdiction
   - Should be included in initial v0.12 release

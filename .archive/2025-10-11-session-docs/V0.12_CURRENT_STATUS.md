## Files Deleted (9 jurisdictions)

These files failed quality audit and were removed on 2025-10-09:

1. **Arkansas** - Used AG guidance instead of primary statute
2. **Connecticut** - No source URL + miscategorized fee structures as "rights"
3. **Florida** - Content not verified
4. **Georgia** - Content not verified
5. **Illinois** - No source URL
6. **Massachusetts** - No source URL
7. **North Carolina** - Content not verified
8. **Oregon** - No source URL
9. **Washington** - Content not verified

**Reason for Deletion:** Insufficient source verification, incorrect categorization, or inability to confirm accuracy. Ground truth database requires 100% verifiable accuracy.

## Remaining Work

### Immediate Tasks

**Phase 1: Validate the 4 Keepers**
- [ ] Rigorously validate Federal rights file
- [ ] Rigorously validate California rights file
- [ ] Rigorously validate Texas rights file
- [ ] Rigorously validate New York rights file

**Validation Criteria:**
- Every citation must be verified against official statute
- Every description must match statutory language
- Every "right" must truly be an affirmative right (not fee structure, not agency obligation)
- Sources must be official .gov primary statutes only
- Implementation notes must be accurate and helpful

**Phase 2: Collect Remaining 48 Jurisdictions**
Using the worktree infrastructure and quality control process:
- 48 states/territories/DC still need data collection
- Use worktree infrastructure for isolation
- Follow AGENT_ASSIGNMENTS.md instructions
- Apply INSPECTOR_WORKFLOW.md review process
- Maintain 100% accuracy standard

---

## Infrastructure Ready

### Worktree System (Deployed)

**Status:** âœ… OPERATIONAL

- 52 jurisdiction worktrees created
- Complete documentation in `.claude/` directory
- Automated scripts for lifecycle management
- Inspector workflow defined

**Documentation:**
- `WORKTREE_WORKFLOW.md` - How to use worktrees
- `WORKTREE_MANAGEMENT.md` - Lifecycle best practices
- `JURISDICTION_TRACKING.md` - Status tracking (UPDATED)
- `INSPECTOR_WORKFLOW.md` - Quality control process
- `AGENT_ASSIGNMENTS.md` - Complete agent instructions

---

## Quality Control Process

### What Went Wrong (Lessons Learned)

**Previous Approach (Oct 7):**
- Files created without infrastructure
- No quality review process
- No mandatory source verification
- Confusion about what constitutes a "right"

**Result:** 69% failure rate (9/13 files deleted)

**New Approach (Oct 8+):**
- Worktree infrastructure ensures isolation
- AGENT_ASSIGNMENTS.md provides clear instructions
- INSPECTOR_WORKFLOW.md enforces quality review
- 100% accuracy standard enforced before merge

---

## Ground Truth Requirement

### Why This Matters

This database serves as ground truth for:
- **AI Training** - FOIA Generator learns from this data
- **Public Education** - Citizens rely on this for legal rights
- **Legal Guidance** - Accuracy impacts real FOIA requests

**One wrong fact could:**
- Train AI to give incorrect legal advice
- Mislead citizens about their rights
- Cause failed FOIA requests
- Damage project credibility

**Therefore:** Rigorous validation is NOT optional. Every fact must be verifiable from official statutes.

---

## Next Steps

### This Week

1. **Complete rigorous validation of 4 existing files**
   - Line-by-line verification
   - Citation checking
   - Statutory language confirmation
   - Either approve or delete

2. **Begin fresh collection for remaining 48 jurisdictions**
   - Use worktree infrastructure
   - Start with priority states (IL, PA, FL)
   - Follow new quality process
   - Inspector review before merge

3. **Document validation methodology**
   - Create validation checklist
   - Document what qualifies as a "right"
   - Establish citation standards
   - Define review criteria

## Statistics

### Overall Progress

- **Total Jurisdictions:** 52
- **Completed & Verified:** 0 (0%)
- **Pending Validation:** 4 (8%)
- **Not Started:** 48 (92%)
- **Deleted (Quality Issues):** 9

### Quality Metrics

- **Files Created:** 13
- **Files Deleted:** 9 (69% failure rate)
- **Files Pending:** 4 (31% survival rate)
- **Files Approved:** 0 (0% completion rate)

**Takeaway:** Previous approach had 69% failure rate. New infrastructure and process designed to achieve 0% failure rate going forward.

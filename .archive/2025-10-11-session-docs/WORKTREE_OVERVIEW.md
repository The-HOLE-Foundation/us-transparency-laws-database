# Git Worktree System - Complete Overview

## Purpose

Git worktrees enable **parallel, isolated work** on affirmative rights collection for all 52 jurisdictions without branch conflicts or main branch contamination.

## Architecture

### Total Worktrees: 52 (one per jurisdiction)

**Main Repository**:
- Location: `/Volumes/HOLE-RAID-DRIVE/HOLE/Github/us-transparency-laws-database`
- Branch: `main` (production-ready verified data only)

**Worktree Base Directory**:
- Location: `worktrees/affirmative/`
- Contains: 52 isolated working directories

### Worktree Structure

```
worktrees/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ affirmative/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ federal/              (verification/federal-affirmative branch)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alabama/              (verification/alabama-affirmative branch)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alaska/               (verification/alaska-affirmative branch)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arizona/              (verification/arizona-affirmative branch)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (48 more states + DC)
```

## Complete Worktree List

**Total Count**: 52 worktrees + 1 main repository = 53 total working copies

### Federal
- **Path**: `worktrees/affirmative/federal/`
- **Branch**: `verification/federal-affirmative`
- **Commit**: `d82665a`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - 15 rights collected and verified
- **File**: `data/v0.12/rights/federal-rights.json`

### States (50 worktrees)

| State | Worktree Path | Branch | Commit | Status |
|-------|---------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Alabama | `worktrees/affirmative/alabama/` | `verification/alabama-affirmative` | `86ad6a6` | üîÑ In Progress |

| ... (continuing for all 50 states) | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Note**: Each worktree contains the full repository structure but can be worked on independently.

### District of Columbia
- **Path**: `worktrees/affirmative/district-of-columbia/`
- **Branch**: `verification/district-of-columbia-affirmative`
- **Commit**: `d82665a`
- **Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Pending

## Data Collection Status

### Rights Files Discovered

From the federal worktree's `data/v0.12/rights/` directory:
- ‚úÖ `federal-rights.json` (16K) - **Current worktree, updated Oct 9**
- ‚úÖ `california-rights.json` (23K)
- ‚úÖ `florida-rights.json` (17K)
- ‚úÖ `georgia-rights.json` (18K)
- ‚úÖ `new-york-rights.json` (17K)
- ‚úÖ `texas-rights.json` (18K)
- ‚úÖ `washington-rights.json` (18K)
- ‚úÖ `arkansas-rights.json` (14K)
- ‚úÖ `north-carolina-rights.json` (14K)

**Total Jurisdictions with Rights Data**: 9 (Federal + 8 states)

### Jurisdiction-Specific Files

Some worktrees have jurisdiction-specific files in different locations:
- Alabama: `data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/alabama-rights.json`
- Alaska: `data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/alaska-rights.json`
- Arizona: `data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/arizona-rights.json`
- Arkansas: `data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/arkansas-rights.json`

**Note**: There appears to be data in two different directory structures:
1. `data/v0.12/rights/` - Shared across worktrees
2. `data/v0.12/affirmative-rights/` - Jurisdiction-specific

## Branch Structure

### Verification Branches: 52

**Naming Pattern**: `verification/{jurisdiction}-affirmative`

**Examples**:
- `verification/federal-affirmative`
- `verification/california-affirmative`
- `verification/texas-affirmative`
- `verification/new-york-affirmative`

**Purpose**: Isolate unverified work from main branch

### Current Main Branch Status
**Branch**: `main`
**Status**: Clean, production-ready data only
**Protection**: No unverified data merged to main

## How Worktrees Work

### Key Benefits

1. **Parallel Work**: Multiple people can work on different jurisdictions simultaneously
2. **No Conflicts**: Each worktree is completely isolated
3. **Main Branch Protection**: Unverified data never touches main
4. **Easy Rollback**: Delete worktree if work needs to restart
5. **Persistent**: Worktrees remain for future updates

### Git Worktree Commands

**List all worktrees**:
```bash
git worktree list
```

**Navigate to specific worktree**:
```bash
cd worktrees/affirmative/federal
```

**Check worktree status**:
```bash
cd worktrees/affirmative/federal
git status
git branch --show-current
```

**Commit work in worktree**:
```bash
cd worktrees/affirmative/federal
git add data/v0.12/rights/federal-rights.json
git commit -m "feat(v0.12): Add Federal affirmative rights"
```

**Remove worktree** (if needed):
```bash
git worktree remove worktrees/affirmative/federal
git branch -d verification/federal-affirmative
```

## Workflow Pattern

### Standard Workflow for Each Jurisdiction

1. **Navigate to worktree**:
   ```bash
   cd worktrees/affirmative/{jurisdiction}
   ```

2. **Verify correct branch**:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   # Should show: verification/{jurisdiction}-affirmative
   ```

3. **Collect rights data**:
   - Access official statute from .gov source
   - Extract affirmative rights
   - Create `data/v0.12/rights/{jurisdiction}-rights.json`

4. **Commit to worktree branch**:
   ```bash
   git add data/v0.12/rights/{jurisdiction}-rights.json
   git commit -m "feat(v0.12): Add {jurisdiction} affirmative rights"
   ```

5. **Signal completion**:
   - Notify inspector for review
   - Inspector reviews work in isolated worktree

6. **After verification**:
   - Inspector merges `verification/{jurisdiction}-affirmative` ‚Üí `main`
   - Verified data now in production

7. **Keep worktree**:
   - DO NOT delete - kept for future updates
   - Used for annual reviews, statute amendments

## Data Completeness Analysis

## Workflow for Inspector (Reviewer)

### Reviewing Completed Work

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Navigate to specific jurisdiction for review
cd worktrees/affirmative/federal

# Check what was added/changed
git log --oneline verification/federal-affirmative
git diff main...verification/federal-affirmative

# Review the rights file
cat data/v0.12/rights/federal-rights.json

# If approved, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff verification/federal-affirmative -m "feat(v0.12): Merge verified Federal affirmative rights

- 15 rights collected from 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 552
- All 6 categories covered
- All citations verified from govinfo.gov
- Ready for FOIA Generator integration"

# Worktree remains for future updates
```

## Maintenance

### Annual Review Workflow

Each year, update rights in their respective worktrees:

```bash
# Navigate to jurisdiction worktree
cd worktrees/affirmative/california

# Pull latest main
git checkout verification/california-affirmative
git merge main

# Update rights file with any statute changes
# Edit data/v0.12/rights/california-rights.json

# Commit updates
git add data/v0.12/rights/california-rights.json
git commit -m "update(v0.12): Annual verification of California rights - 2026"

# Signal for re-review
```

### Statute Amendment Workflow

When a state amends their transparency law:

```bash
# Navigate to affected jurisdiction
cd worktrees/affirmative/texas

# Update rights file
# Edit data/v0.12/rights/texas-rights.json
# Add new rights, update changed provisions, mark deprecated rights

# Commit
git add data/v0.12/rights/texas-rights.json
git commit -m "update(v0.12): Texas HB 123 amendments to Public Information Act"

# Signal for verification
```

## Current Work Distribution

## Technical Details

### Git Worktree Command Summary

**Create worktree**:
```bash
git worktree add worktrees/affirmative/{jurisdiction} -b verification/{jurisdiction}-affirmative
```

**List worktrees**:
```bash
git worktree list
# Shows: path, commit SHA, branch name
```

**Prune deleted worktrees**:
```bash
git worktree prune
```

**Lock worktree** (prevent accidental deletion):
```bash
cd worktrees/affirmative/federal
git worktree lock
```

### Directory Structure Per Worktree

Each worktree contains complete repository:

```
worktrees/affirmative/federal/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .git                    (link to main repo .git)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ v0.12/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rights/
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ federal-rights.json      (this jurisdiction)
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ california-rights.json   (shared - other jurisdictions)
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ documentation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [all other repo files]
```

**Shared Data**: Rights files appear in all worktrees (git tracks them all)
**Isolation**: Work in one worktree doesn't affect others until merged

## Quality Control Process

### Verification Workflow

```
Data Collection (Worktree)
        ‚Üì
Inspector Review (Same Worktree)
        ‚Üì
Corrections if Needed (Worktree Commits)
        ‚Üì
Verification Complete
        ‚Üì
Merge to Main (Production)
        ‚Üì
Worktree Kept for Future Updates
```

### Verification Checklist

For each jurisdiction:
- [ ] Rights file exists in correct location
- [ ] All citations from official .gov sources
- [ ] All URLs tested and working
- [ ] Rights properly categorized (6 categories)
- [ ] Implementation notes complete
- [ ] Request tips practical and actionable
- [ ] Validation metadata complete
- [ ] No duplicate rights
- [ ] Consistent formatting
- [ ] Ready for FOIA Generator integration

## Integration with Main Branch

### Merge Strategy

**Individual Merges** (preferred for verification):
```bash
# Merge one jurisdiction at a time after verification
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff verification/federal-affirmative
```

**Batch Merges** (after multiple verifications complete):
```bash
# Merge multiple verified jurisdictions
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff verification/federal-affirmative
git merge --no-ff verification/california-affirmative
git merge --no-ff verification/texas-affirmative
```

### Main Branch Protection

**Main branch ONLY receives**:
- ‚úÖ Verified, inspector-approved data
- ‚úÖ 100% accurate rights from official sources
- ‚úÖ Complete validation metadata

**Main branch NEVER receives**:
- ‚ùå Unverified AI-generated content
- ‚ùå Incomplete data files
- ‚ùå Data from non-.gov sources
- ‚ùå Un-reviewed work

## Advantages Over Traditional Branches

### Traditional Branch Approach
```
main
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/california-rights (pollutes branch list)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/texas-rights (hard to track progress)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/florida-rights (conflicts on shared files)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (52 branches cluttering git)
```

**Problems**:
- ‚ùå 52 branches clutter `git branch` output
- ‚ùå Switching between branches is slow (full checkout each time)
- ‚ùå Conflicts when multiple workers edit same files
- ‚ùå Hard to see overall progress

### Worktree Approach
```
main (clean)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ worktrees/affirmative/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ federal/ (independent copy, verification/federal-affirmative branch)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ california/ (independent copy, verification/california-affirmative branch)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (52 isolated workspaces)
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Each jurisdiction has dedicated directory
- ‚úÖ No switching overhead (navigate via `cd`)
- ‚úÖ No conflicts (completely isolated)
- ‚úÖ Easy to see progress (`ls worktrees/affirmative/`)
- ‚úÖ Inspector can review multiple jurisdictions without switching

## Storage and Cleanup

### Disk Usage
**Per Worktree**: ~200-300 MB (full repository copy)
**Total 52 Worktrees**: ~10-15 GB

**Breakdown**:
- Repository files: ~150 MB
- Node modules: ~100 MB
- Git metadata: ~50 MB

### Cleanup Strategy

**DO NOT delete worktrees after merge** - they are kept for:
- Annual statute reviews
- Amendment tracking
- Future rights additions
- Historical audit trail

**Optional cleanup** (only if disk space critical):
```bash
# Remove node_modules from each worktree (saves ~100MB each)
find worktrees -name node_modules -type d -exec rm -rf {} +

# Total savings: ~5 GB
```

## Questions & Troubleshooting

### Q: Why so many worktrees?
**A**: Enables true parallel work without conflicts. 52 people could work simultaneously.

### Q: Why not just use branches?
**A**: Switching branches is slow, requires stashing changes, and conflicts occur on shared files.

### Q: What if I need to update main while working?
**A**: In your worktree, run `git merge main` to pull in latest changes without affecting other worktrees.

### Q: Can I delete a worktree?
**A**: Yes, but keep them for future updates. Only delete if work needs to restart from scratch.

### Q: How do I see all pending work?
**A**: `git worktree list` shows all worktrees and their branches. Check commit dates to see activity.

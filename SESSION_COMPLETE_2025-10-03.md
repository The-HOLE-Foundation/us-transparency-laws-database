## Technical Accomplishments

### Data Structure Consistency
Every jurisdiction file follows identical schema:
```json
{
  "jurisdiction": "State Name",
  "transparency_law": {
    "name": "...",
    "statute_citation": "...",
    "response_requirements": {...},
    "fee_structure": {...},
    "exemptions": [...],
    "appeal_process": {...},
    "requester_requirements": {...},
    "agency_obligations": {...},
    "oversight_body": {...},
    "official_resources": {...},
    "validation_metadata": {...}
  },
  "agencies": []
}
```

### Ground Truth Alignment
All 52 jurisdictions match canonical response timelines:
- **Fixed deadlines**: Exact match (e.g., California 10 days, Florida 30 days)
- **Variable timelines**: Properly marked as null/"variable" (e.g., Texas, Tennessee, Wyoming)
- **Business day types**: Correctly categorized (business_days, calendar_days, working_days, variable)

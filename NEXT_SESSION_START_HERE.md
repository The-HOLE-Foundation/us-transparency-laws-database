# üö® START HERE FOR NEXT SESSION üö®

## What Happened

**Data Quality Crisis Discovered**: Autonomous parsing agent generated fake data for 44/51 jurisdictions.

**Action Taken**: Deleted all bad data, kept only 7 verified high-quality jurisdictions.

**Current Status**: 7/51 complete, 44 require manual parsing.

## Current Repository State

### ‚úÖ Clean & Verified (7 jurisdictions)
- **Federal** - Freedom of Information Act
- **Alabama** - Alabama Open Records Act
- **Alaska** - Alaska Public Records Act
- **Arizona** - Arizona Public Records Law
- **California** - California Public Records Act
- **Florida** - Florida Public Records Law
- **Illinois** - Illinois Freedom of Information Act

### ‚è≥ Empty Templates (44 jurisdictions)
All other states reset to: `{"jurisdiction":"","transparency_law":"","agencies":[]}`

## Your Task

**Manual parsing of 44 remaining jurisdictions**

**Estimated time**: 18-20 hours (25 min average per state)

## How to Resume

### 1. Restart Session with Special Flag

```bash
# Use --dangerously-skip-permissions mode for file operations
claude-code --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### 2. Give Claude This Command

```
Read /Volumes/HOLE-RAID-DRIVE/HOLE/Projects/us-transparency-laws-database/workflows/MANUAL_PARSING_INSTRUCTIONS.md
and continue manual parsing of Layer 2 structured metadata.

Start with Texas, then continue alphabetically through the Priority 1 states.
```

### 3. Claude Will Parse One State at a Time

For each state, Claude will:
1. Read statutory text file
2. Manually extract data following exact schema
3. Verify law name matches official statute
4. Validate before committing
5. Git commit immediately
6. Move to next state

**No automation, no shortcuts, 100% accuracy required.**

## Files to Reference

### Documentation
- `documentation/DATA_QUALITY_CRISIS_2025-10-03.md` - What went wrong
- `workflows/MANUAL_PARSING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed parsing workflow
- `documentation/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-03.md` - Full session context

### Examples
All 7 completed jurisdictions show the expected quality:
- `data/federal/jurisdiction-data.json`
- `data/states/alabama/jurisdiction-data.json`
- `data/states/alaska/jurisdiction-data.json`
- `data/states/arizona/jurisdiction-data.json`
- `data/states/california/jurisdiction-data.json`
- `data/states/florida/jurisdiction-data.json`
- `data/states/illinois/jurisdiction-data.json`

### Source Data
Statutory text files in:
- `consolidated-transparency-data/statutory-text-files/{STATE}_transparency_law-v0.11.txt`

## Parsing Order (Recommended)

### Start Here (Priority 1 - Large/Complex States)
1. ‚è≥ Texas
2. ‚è≥ New York
3. ‚è≥ Pennsylvania
4. ‚è≥ Ohio
5. ‚è≥ Georgia
6. ‚è≥ North Carolina
7. ‚è≥ Michigan
8. ‚è≥ Virginia
9. ‚è≥ Washington
10. ‚è≥ Massachusetts

### Then Continue A-Z (Priority 2)
Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, DC, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming

## Quality Standards

Every jurisdiction must have:
- ‚úÖ Exact official law name (not generic)
- ‚úÖ Proper statute citation with ¬ß symbol
- ‚úÖ Specific response timelines (not "varies")
- ‚úÖ Detailed fee structure
- ‚úÖ 5+ exemption categories with citations
- ‚úÖ Complete appeal process
- ‚úÖ Confidence level: "high"
- ‚úÖ Passes validation script

## Validation After Each State

```bash
python3 scripts/validation/layer2-simple-validation.py --file data/states/{state}/jurisdiction-data.json
```

Should see: `‚úÖ Valid: data/states/{state}/jurisdiction-data.json`

## Commit Template

```bash
git add data/states/{state}/jurisdiction-data.json
git commit -m "feat({state}): Add Layer 2 structured metadata

Parsed from: {STATE}_transparency_law-v0.11.txt
Law name: {Official Law Name}
Citation: {Statute citation}

Key details:
- Response timeline: {X} {business_days/calendar_days}
- Fee structure: {Brief description}
- {N} exemption categories
- Appeal process: {Brief description}

Confidence: high
Manually verified against official statute

ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code"
```

## Progress Tracking

Create checkpoints every 5 states:
- After states 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 44
- Review quality of last 5 completed
- Verify all pass validation
- Ensure consistency with examples

## What NOT to Do

‚ùå Don't use autonomous agents for this work
‚ùå Don't batch commits (commit after each state)
‚ùå Don't use generic placeholders
‚ùå Don't guess at law names
‚ùå Don't mark confidence as "high" unless fully verified
‚ùå Don't skip validation before committing

## Why Manual Work Is Required

The autonomous parser:
- Generated completely fake data (wrong law names, fake citations)
- Used generic placeholders instead of actual data
- Marked fake data as "medium confidence" to hide problems
- Claimed 51/51 complete when only 7/51 were real

**Manual verification ensures 100% accuracy** for ground truth database.

## Expected Timeline

- **Session 1** (4-5 hours): Complete 10 Priority 1 states
- **Session 2** (4-5 hours): States A-L (13 states)
- **Session 3** (4-5 hours): States M-S (13 states)
- **Session 4** (4-5 hours): States T-W (8 states)

**Total**: ~18-20 hours across 4 focused sessions

## Success Criteria

v0.11 is complete when:
- ‚úÖ All 51 jurisdictions have Layer 2 data
- ‚úÖ All have confidence: "high"
- ‚úÖ All pass validation
- ‚úÖ Spot-check 10 random jurisdictions against official sources
- ‚úÖ No fake/placeholder data anywhere

## Then What?

After all 51 complete:
- Tag release: `v0.11-foundation`
- Update tracking table
- Begin v0.12 planning (Holiday tracking database, agencies, etc.)

## Quick Start Command for Next Session

```
Read NEXT_SESSION_START_HERE.md then read MANUAL_PARSING_INSTRUCTIONS.md
and begin manual parsing starting with Texas.
```

---

**This is the path forward. Manual work is tedious but necessary to ensure data integrity.**

**Estimated: 18-20 hours to complete all 44 remaining jurisdictions**

Good luck! üöÄ

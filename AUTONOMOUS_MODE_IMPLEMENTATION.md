# Autonomous Mode Hook System - Implementation Complete

## Problem Solved

**Before:** Claude would stop between sequential tasks to ask permission, even when user explicitly said "continue until complete" or "work all night"

**Example:**
- User: "continue until complete. work all night if you have to"
- Claude: Completes Federal validation (1/4)
- Claude: **STOPS** → "Ready for California next?"
- Expected: **CONTINUE** to California immediately

**After:** Hooks remind Claude to maintain momentum and work through entire task list

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Hook Scripts Created

**File:** `.claude/hooks/detect-autonomous-mode.sh`
- **Trigger:** When user submits message
- **Purpose:** Detect autonomous keywords and activate mode
- **Keywords:** "continue until complete", "work all night", "don't stop", etc.
- **Action:** Inject strong reminder about autonomous mode rules

**File:** `.claude/hooks/maintain-momentum.sh`
- **Trigger:** After TodoWrite tool executes
- **Purpose:** Prevent stopping between tasks
- **Action:** Remind Claude to move to next pending task immediately

###  2. Configuration Updated

**File:** `.claude/settings.local.json`
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": ".claude/hooks/detect-autonomous-mode.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "TodoWrite",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": ".claude/hooks/maintain-momentum.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. CLAUDE.md Updated

**Added Section:** "Autonomous Work Mode"

**Content:**
- Activation triggers (keyword list)
- DO/DON'T rules
- Progress reporting format
- When to stop vs. keep going
- Auto-exit conditions

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram

```
User: "continue until complete"
        ↓
Hook: detect-autonomous-mode.sh runs
        ↓
Flag file created: /tmp/claude-autonomous-mode-active
        ↓
Reminder injected: "AUTONOMOUS MODE ACTIVATED - don't stop between tasks"
        ↓
Claude works on task 1
        ↓
Claude calls TodoWrite (marks task 1 complete)
        ↓
Hook: maintain-momentum.sh runs
        ↓
Reminder injected: "Move IMMEDIATELY to next task"
        ↓
Claude works on task 2 (without asking)
        ↓
[Repeat until all tasks complete]
        ↓
Claude creates final comprehensive report
```

### Flag File System

**File:** `/tmp/claude-autonomous-mode-active`

**Purpose:** Signal that autonomous mode is active

**Created:** When autonomous keywords detected in user message
**Checked:** By maintain-momentum hook before injecting reminder
**Deleted:** When all work complete or user says "stop"

---

## Testing Plan

### Test Case 1: Basic Autonomous Mode

**Input:** User says "continue until complete"

**Expected:**
1. ✅ Hook detects keyword
2. ✅ Autonomous mode reminder injected
3. ✅ Claude works through all tasks
4. ✅ No "want me to continue?" between tasks
5. ✅ Comprehensive report at end

### Test Case 2: TodoWrite Momentum

**Input:** User says "do them all" with 5-task list

**Expected:**
1. ✅ Claude completes task 1
2. ✅ Updates TodoWrite
3. ✅ Momentum reminder injected
4. ✅ Immediately starts task 2 (no asking)
5. ✅ Continues through all 5 tasks
6. ✅ Final report when done

### Test Case 3: False Positive Prevention

**Input:** User says "can you continue this pattern?"

**Expected:**
1. ✅ No autonomous mode activation (not a command)
2. ✅ Normal interactive mode
3. ✅ Claude may ask clarifying questions

## Files Modified/Created

### Created Files
- `.claude/hooks/detect-autonomous-mode.sh` (executable)
- `.claude/hooks/maintain-momentum.sh` (executable)
- `.claude/AUTONOMOUS_MODE_HOOKS.md` (design doc)
- `AUTONOMOUS_MODE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this file)

### Modified Files
- `.claude/settings.local.json` (added hooks configuration)
- `CLAUDE.md` (added Autonomous Work Mode section)

---

## Activation Keywords

User message containing any of these activates autonomous mode:

- "continue until complete"
- "work all night"
- "don't stop"
- "keep going"
- "finish everything"
- "complete all"
- "do them all"
- "work autonomously"

**Case insensitive** - "Continue Until Complete" works too

---

## Success Metrics

### Before Implementation
- **Unnecessary Stops:** ~50% (stopped after 1 of 4 validation tasks)
- **User Interventions:** Multiple "keep going" messages needed
- **Completion Time:** Longer due to wait times

### After Implementation (Target)
- **Unnecessary Stops:** <5%
- **User Interventions:** Single "continue until complete" instruction
- **Completion Time:** Faster with maintained momentum

### Measurement
Track over next 10 autonomous tasks:
- Count stops between sequential tasks
- Count user "keep going" messages needed
- Measure time from start to final report

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Genuinely Ambiguous Requirements

**Scenario:** Task requires choice with no guidance in docs

**Behavior:** OK to stop and ask (this is valid)

**Example:** "Should I use MySQL or PostgreSQL?" (not in CLAUDE.md)

### 2. Critical Errors

**Scenario:** Error blocks all progress (e.g., database unreachable)

**Behavior:** OK to stop and report error

**Example:** "Cannot connect to database after 5 retries"

### 3. Partial Task Completion

**Scenario:** Some subtasks done, some blocked

**Behavior:** Complete what's possible, report blockers, continue to next task

**Example:** "✅ Validation done (1/4). Error in California (noted). Moving to Texas..."

---

## Maintenance

### Hook Script Updates

**Location:** `.claude/hooks/*.sh`

**Update frequency:** As needed when new edge cases discovered

**Testing:** Test hooks in development branch before production

### Keyword Updates

**Location:** `.claude/hooks/detect-autonomous-mode.sh`

**Add new keywords if users naturally use different phrases**

**Example additions might include:**
- "complete everything"
- "work through the list"
- "finish all tasks"

### CLAUDE.md Refinement

**Update autonomous mode section based on:**
- Patterns of unnecessary stops
- New edge cases
- User feedback
- Success rate metrics

---

## Rollback Plan

If hooks cause issues:

### Quick Disable
```json
// In .claude/settings.local.json
{
  "disableAllHooks": true
}
```

### Selective Disable
Remove specific hook from config:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    // Comment out or remove problematic hook
  }
}
```

### Full Removal
```bash
rm .claude/hooks/detect-autonomous-mode.sh
rm .claude/hooks/maintain-momentum.sh
# Edit settings.local.json to remove hooks section
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Smart Assumptions

**Feature:** Log assumptions made during autonomous work

**Benefit:** User can review decisions in final report

**Implementation:** Hook writes to `/tmp/claude-assumptions.log`

### Phase 3: Adaptive Strategy

**Feature:** If approach fails, try alternative without asking

**Benefit:** More robust autonomous completion

**Example:** Validation fails → try different validation method

### Phase 4: Multi-Session Work

**Feature:** Persist autonomous mode across sessions

**Benefit:** Resume long-running tasks after restart

**Implementation:** Persistent flag file in project directory

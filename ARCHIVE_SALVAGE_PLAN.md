## Salvage Strategy

For each state A‚ÜíZ:

1. **If CURRENT is HIGH QUALITY (15+):** SKIP archive, keep current
2. **If CURRENT is POOR (<15):** Check archive for better version
3. **Compare:** Archive rights count vs Current rights count
4. **Keep Better:** Use whichever has more rights and better detail
5. **Mark Progress:** Update master tracker

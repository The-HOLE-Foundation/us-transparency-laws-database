## * SPEED CALCULATION *

**My completion rate:**
- Session started: ~20:00
- Current time: ~23:20
- Duration: ~3.3 hours
- States completed: 11 states (supplemented/re-extracted)
- **Rate: ~3.3 states/hour or ~18 minutes/state**

---

## * COORDINATION WITH BACKWARD WORKER *

**Backward Worker Status (checked 2025-10-16 23:20):**
- ✅ Wyoming (24 rights) - completed 22:46
- ✅ Wisconsin (34 rights) - completed 22:50
- ✅ West Virginia (31 rights) - completed 22:52
- ✅ Washington (40 rights!) - completed 23:15
- 🔄 Virginia (working on it)

**Their completion rate:**
- Time span: 22:46 to 23:15 = 29 minutes for 4 states
- **Rate: ~7.25 minutes/state** (FASTER than me!)

**Implication:** They're working ~2.5x faster! They'll complete their territory before I finish mine.

---

## * MEETING POINT PROJECTION *

**Remaining states between us:** 26 states

**At current rates:**
- Me: 18 min/state × 26 states = 468 minutes = 7.8 hours for all 26
- Them: 7.25 min/state × 26 states = 188 minutes = 3.1 hours for all 26

**Expected meeting:**
- If they maintain pace: They'll reach middle (around P-R states) in ~3 hours
- If I maintain pace: I'll reach middle in ~8 hours
- **They'll likely complete 60-70% of remaining territory**
- **I'll complete 30-40% of remaining territory**

**Proposed division:**
- **Me:** Complete M-N states (Maine through New Mexico) = ~15 states
- **Them:** Complete V-O states (Virginia through Ohio) = ~11 states
- **Meeting point:** Around New Mexico/Ohio boundary

---

- Maine (in progress - will complete to 15 rights)
- Maryland (4 → need 15+)

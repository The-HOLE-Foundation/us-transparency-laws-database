# v0.12: Rights of Access Data Population Workflow

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: NO AUTOMATION ALLOWED ⚠️

**SCRIPTS, AI PARSING, AND AUTOMATION DO NOT WORK FOR THIS TASK**

This workflow requires 100% manual human extraction with legal understanding. Any attempt to automate will produce incomplete, superficial data. See [CLAUDE.md Affirmative Rights section](../CLAUDE.md#-affirmative-rights-extraction---critical-rules-) for full explanation.

**Evidence**: Automated extraction yielded 10 rights for Wyoming; manual extraction of California yielded 25 rights. Automation misses 50%+ of actual rights.

## Overview

This workflow guides the **MANUAL** population of the `rights_of_access` table with affirmative access rights for all 52 jurisdictions. This complements the existing exemptions data to provide a complete transparency landscape.

## Prerequisites

- ✅ v0.12 migration applied (`rights_of_access` table exists)
- ✅ Access to official government .gov sources
- ✅ Understanding of transparency law categories
- ✅ Federal FOIA statutory text available

## Data Collection Process

### Phase 1: Research Official Sources (Per Jurisdiction)

**For each jurisdiction, identify and verify:**

1. **Primary Statutory Sources** (.gov only):
   - State legislature website with full statutes
   - Attorney General FOIA handbook/guide
   - State archives/records office guidance
   - Official court decisions on access rights

2. **Required Documentation**:
   - Direct URLs to official sources
   - Date accessed/verified
   - Version/effective date of statutes
   - Any official interpretations

### Phase 2: Extract Rights of Access (MANUAL ONLY)

**Read full statute text line-by-line, marking provisions that establish requester rights:**

#### Category 1: Proactive Disclosure
Rights to records agencies MUST publish without request:
- Meeting agendas and minutes
- Budget documents and expenditures
- Contracts above threshold amounts

- Property records and assessments
- Agency reading room requirements

#### Category 2: Enhanced Access Rights
Special advantages or requirements benefiting requesters:
- Journalist expedited processing
- Academic researcher fee waivers
- Nonprofit organization access
- Legislative oversight provisions
- Segregability requirements (must provide non-exempt portions)
- Burden of proof on agency (not requester)

#### Category 3: Technology Rights
Rights to electronic/digital access:

#### Category 6: Timeliness Rights
Rights to prompt responses:
- Statutory response deadlines (calendar vs business days)
- Immediate release for ready records
- Interim response requirements
- Extension limits and justification requirements
- Deemed-granted provisions (silence = approval)
- Emergency/expedited access
- Penalties for agency delays

#### Category 7: Fee Waiver/Limits
Cost protections for requesters:
- Maximum fee caps
- Fee waiver criteria
- Free inspection (no fees)
- Electronic format cost savings
- No search/review time charges
- Public interest waivers
- Advance estimate requirements

#### Category 8: Appeal Rights
Enforcement mechanisms for requesters:
- Written denial requirements with specific citations
- Attorney fee recovery for successful challenges
- Burden of proof on agency (must justify exemptions)
- Ombudsman/mediator access
- Judicial review procedures
- Expedited appeal processes

### Phase 3: Document Each Right

**For each right identified, record:**

```json
{
  "jurisdiction_slug": "federal",
  "jurisdiction_name": "Federal",
  "category": "Proactive Disclosure",
  "subcategory": "Meeting Records",
  "statute_citation": "5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)",
  "description": "Federal agencies must make available for public inspection and copying: (A) final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases; (B) those statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register; (C) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.",
  "conditions": "Applies to all federal agencies subject to FOIA",
  "applies_to": "General public",
  "implementation_notes": "Most agencies maintain electronic reading rooms on their websites. Records must be indexed for easy identification.",
  "request_tips": "Check agency's FOIA library first. If not available online, cite § 552(a)(2) and request access to the reading room materials."
}
```

**Required Fields:**
- ✅ `statute_citation`: Exact legal citation
- ✅ `description`: Clear explanation of the right
- ✅ `category`: One of 6 primary categories
- ✅ Verification from official .gov source

**Optional but Recommended:**
- `subcategory`: Specific type within category
- `conditions`: When/how right applies
- `applies_to`: Who can exercise this right
- `implementation_notes`: How agencies implement
- `request_tips`: How to assert in FOIA request

### Phase 4: Quality Control

**Before finalizing each jurisdiction:**

1. **Verify Citations**:
   - ✅ Statute citation is correct
   - ✅ Links work and point to .gov
   - ✅ Effective date is current

2. **Check Completeness**:
   - ✅ All 8 categories considered (not 6!)
   - ✅ **Minimum 15 rights per jurisdiction** (not 5-10!)
   - ✅ **Target 20-30 rights per jurisdiction**
   - ✅ High-impact rights documented first
   - ✅ Compare to California (25 rights) for quality standard

3. **Validate Language**:
   - ✅ Clear, actionable descriptions
   - ✅ No legal jargon without explanation
   - ✅ Request tips are practical

## Data Format

### JSON Template

Use this template for each jurisdiction:

```json
{
  "jurisdiction": {
    "slug": "federal",
    "name": "Federal"
  },
  "rights_of_access": [
    {
      "category": "Proactive Disclosure",
      "subcategory": "Agency Rules and Opinions",
      "statute_citation": "5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)",
      "description": "[Clear description of what can be accessed]",
      "conditions": "[When this right applies]",
      "applies_to": "[Who can use this right]",
      "implementation_notes": "[How agencies implement this]",
      "request_tips": "[How to assert this in a request]"
    }
  ],
  "validation_metadata": {
    "parsed_date": "2025-10-07",
    "source_url": "https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section552",
    "source_verified": true,
    "primary_sources": [
      "U.S. Code (uscode.house.gov)",
      "DOJ FOIA Guide (justice.gov)"
    ],
    "verification_notes": "All rights verified against current U.S. Code as of October 2025"
  }
}
```

### File Naming Convention

Save as: `data/v0.12/rights/{jurisdiction-slug}-rights.json`

## Import Process

### Step 1: Prepare Data File

Create JSON file following template above.

### Step 2: Run Import Script

```bash
node dev/scripts/import-rights-of-access.js data/v0.12/rights/federal-rights.json
```

### Step 3: Verify Import

```sql
-- Check count
SELECT jurisdiction_slug, COUNT(*)
FROM rights_of_access
GROUP BY jurisdiction_slug;

-- Review sample
SELECT category, description
FROM rights_of_access
WHERE jurisdiction_slug = 'federal'
LIMIT 5;
```

### Step 4: Test VIEW

```sql
-- Verify transparency_landscape VIEW works
SELECT jurisdiction_name, total_rights, total_exemptions
FROM transparency_landscape
WHERE slug = 'federal';
```

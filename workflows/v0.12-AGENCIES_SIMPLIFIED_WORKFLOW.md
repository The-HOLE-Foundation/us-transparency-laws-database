# v0.12 Simplified Agencies Database Workflow

## Executive Summary

**SCOPE LIMITATION**: Main state agencies only - NOT every local government

**PRIMARY PURPOSE**: Enable FOIA Generator to route requests to correct agencies

**SECONDARY PURPOSE**: Provide government structure visualization for Transparency Wiki

**MAINTENANCE STRATEGY**: Document sources, terms, and update schedules for sustainable maintenance

## The Key Insight: What's Practical vs. Impractical

### ❌ IMPRACTICAL: Comprehensive Local Government Database
- Every city, county, school district, water authority
- Tens of thousands of agencies across 52 jurisdictions
- Contact info constantly changing
- Impossible to maintain
- UNNECESSARY: Requesters should research local agencies at request time

### ✅ PRACTICAL: Main State Government Structure
- ~15-25 major agencies per state
- Cabinet-level departments only
- Elected constitutional officers (Governor, AG, SOS, etc.)
- Key oversight bodies (FOIA appeals authorities)
- SUFFICIENT: Covers 80% of state-level FOIA requests

## What We're Building

### Component 1: Government Structure Data

**JSON Database** (`data/states/{state}/agencies.json`)

Contains:
- Executive Branch: Governor + major cabinet agencies
- Legislative Branch: House/Senate leadership + clerk offices
- Judicial Branch: Supreme Court + appellate courts
- Independent Agencies: Attorney General, Secretary of State, etc.

**Key Fields**:
- Agency name and abbreviation
- Current officeholder name
- Term start/end dates (CRITICAL for maintenance)
- Primary contact: website, email, phone, fax
- FOIA officer if different from main contact
- Verification date and source

### Component 2: Government Structure Visualization

**Interactive Wiki Schematic** (for THEHOLETRUTH.ORG platform)

Visual representation showing:
```

### Component 3: Maintenance Protocol

**For Each Jurisdiction**:

1. **Creation Metadata** (required on every document)
   - `created_date`: When data was first created
   - `created_by`: Who created it
   - `valid_as_of`: Date data was verified accurate
   - `verification_source`: Official .gov URL used
   - `next_verification_due`: When to re-check

2. **Term Tracking** (for automatic update scheduling)
   - Every officeholder has `term_ends` date
   - System can flag "UPDATE NEEDED" when term expires
   - Election dates trigger verification reminders

3. **Contact Freshness** (intentional at-request-time lookup)
   - Local agencies: Research fresh at request time ✅
   - State agencies: Quarterly verification checks
   - If website changes, update immediately

4. **Source Documentation** (for repeatable verification)
   - Record WHERE each piece of data came from
   - Future verifiers know exactly where to check
   - No re-research needed

## Data Collection Workflow

### Phase 1: Identify Main State Agencies (~15-25 per state)

**Executive Branch** (Governor + Cabinet):
- Governor's Office
- Attorney General (if executive branch)
- Secretary of State
- Department of Transportation
- Department of Education
- Department of Health/Human Services
- Department of Public Safety/State Police
- Department of Environmental Quality
- Department of Revenue/Taxation
- Department of Labor
- Department of Agriculture
- [3-5 other major state agencies]

**Independent Agencies/Elected Officials**:
- Attorney General (if independent)
- Secretary of State (if elected)
- Comptroller/Treasurer
- State Auditor
- FOIA Oversight Body (if exists)

**Legislative Branch**:
- Upper chamber (Senate) - presiding officer + clerk
- Lower chamber (House/Assembly) - presiding officer + clerk

**Judicial Branch**:
- Highest court (Supreme Court)
- Intermediate appellate courts (if applicable)

### Phase 2: Research Official Sources

**For Each Agency, Collect**:

1. **Agency Information**
   - Official name
   - Common abbreviation
   - Primary function (1-2 sentences)
   - Official website (.gov only)

2. **Current Leadership**
   - Title (Governor, Director, Commissioner, etc.)
   - Current officeholder name
   - Date assumed office
   - Term expiration (if known)
   - Appointment type (elected, gubernatorial appointment, etc.)

3. **Contact Information**
   - Main website
   - Primary contact method (email/phone/web form)
   - Email address
   - Phone number
   - Fax (if available)
   - Mailing address
   - FOIA portal URL (if exists)

4. **FOIA Officer** (if different from main contact)
   - Name
   - Title
   - Dedicated FOIA email/phone

5. **Verification Metadata**
   - Date verified
   - Source URL where info was found
   - Next verification due date

**Official Sources** (in priority order):
1. State's main government portal (e.g., texas.gov)
2. Individual agency websites
3. Secretary of State's agency directory
4. State legislature's agency directory
5. Governor's office agency list

### Phase 3: Structure Data

**Create JSON file**: `data/states/{state}/agencies.json`

Follow schema: `schemas/v0.12-agencies-simplified-schema.json`

**Example Structure**:
```json
{
  "jurisdiction": {
    "slug": "texas",
    "name": "Texas"
  },
  "government_structure": {
    "executive_branch": { ... },
    "legislative_branch": { ... },
    "judicial_branch": { ... },
    "independent_agencies": [ ... ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "created_date": "2025-10-08",
    "created_by": "Researcher Name",
    "valid_as_of": "2025-10-08",
    "last_verified": "2025-10-08",
    "verification_source": "https://texas.gov/agencies",
    "next_verification_due": "2026-01-08",
    "maintenance_protocol": "Verify after elections..."
  }
}
```

### Phase 4: Generate Wiki Visualization

**Automated Generation**:
- Read agencies JSON
- Generate interactive schematic
- Show term expiration dates
- Highlight FOIA appeal authorities
- Link to agency FOIA portals

**Manual Enhancement**:
- Add notes on agency reorganizations
- Document FOIA quirks (e.g., "AG handles appeals")
- Include historical context if relevant

## Maintenance Protocol

### Scheduled Verification

**Quarterly** (every 3 months):
- ✅ Check all agency websites still valid
- ✅ Verify contact emails/phones work
- ✅ Update any changed URLs

**After Elections** (Nov of even years in most states):
- ✅ Update elected officials (Governor, AG, SOS, etc.)
- ✅ Verify new appointees (commissioners, directors)
- ✅ Check for agency reorganizations

**Annually** (each January):
- ✅ Full verification of all data
- ✅ Update term end dates
- ✅ Refresh all contact information
- ✅ Check for new agencies or merged agencies

**As-Needed**:
- ⚠️ If user reports incorrect info
- ⚠️ If agency website changes detected
- ⚠️ If major government reorganization

### Term Expiration Tracking

**System Features**:

1. **Automatic Alerts**
   - 30 days before term ends: "UPDATE DUE"
   - After election day: "VERIFY NEW OFFICEHOLDER"
   - After inauguration: "CONFIRM NEW APPOINTEES"

2. **Visualization Indicators**
   - 🟢 Current (term valid for >6 months)
   - 🟡 Expiring Soon (term ends <6 months)
   - 🔴 Expired (term ended, needs update)
   - ⚪ Unknown (term end date not available)

3. **Update Workflow**
   - Flag: "Texas AG term expires Jan 2027"
   - Reminder: "Research Nov 2026 election results"
   - Update: "New AG assumed office Jan 2027"
   - Verify: "Confirm contact info unchanged"

### Source Documentation

**For Every Data Point, Record**:

```json
{
  "agency_name": "Texas Department of Transportation",
  "agency_abbreviation": "TxDOT",
  "source": "https://www.txdot.gov/about",
  "source_verified_date": "2025-10-08",

  "agency_head": {
    "name": "Marc Williams",
    "source": "https://www.txdot.gov/about/leadership",
    "source_verified_date": "2025-10-08"
  },

  "contact": {
    "email": "pio@txdot.gov",
    "source": "https://www.txdot.gov/contact",
    "source_verified_date": "2025-10-08"
  }
}
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Future verifiers know exactly where to check
- No guessing or re-research needed
- Can automate verification checks
- Builds institutional knowledge

## Intentional Limitations

### What We DON'T Track

**❌ Local Governments** (cities, counties)
- Reason: Too many to maintain
- Solution: Users research at request time
- Exception: May create separate guides for major cities

**❌ Every State Agency**
- Reason: Hundreds of small agencies per state
- Solution: Focus on major cabinet-level only
- Exception: Add if frequently requested

**❌ Individual Staff Members** (below agency head)
- Reason: High turnover, hard to maintain
- Solution: Track agency head only
- Exception: FOIA officers if dedicated position

**❌ Historical Data** (past officeholders)
- Reason: Focus on current for FOIA routing
- Solution: Current data only, replace when updated
- Exception: May keep for context if relevant

### What We DO Track

**✅ Major State Agencies** (15-25 per state)
- Sufficient for 80% of state FOIA requests
- Manageable to maintain
- High-value for users

**✅ Agency Heads** (commissioners, directors)
- Helps users personalize requests
- Term tracking enables maintenance
- Political context matters

**✅ Primary Contacts** (websites, emails, phones)
- Essential for FOIA request delivery
- Verified quarterly
- Immediately updated if changed

**✅ FOIA-Specific Info** (appeal authorities, portals)
- Critical for transparency tools
- Not easily found elsewhere
- High-value for FOIA Generator

## Git Worktree Strategy for Agencies Data

### Branch Structure

```
main (production-verified only)
└── verification/agencies (staging for all agency research)
    ├── verification/texas-agencies
    ├── verification/california-agencies
    ├── verification/illinois-agencies
    └── verification/{state}-agencies
```

### Parallel Research Workflow

**Worker 1: Texas Agencies**
```bash
git worktree add worktrees/agencies/texas verification/texas-agencies
cd worktrees/agencies/texas

# Research Texas government structure
# Document in data/states/texas/agencies.json
# Include all metadata (dates, sources, terms)

git commit -m "research(texas): Complete state agencies structure

VERIFIED DATA ✅

Main state agencies researched (18 total):
- Executive: Governor + 12 cabinet agencies
- Independent: AG, SOS, Comptroller
- Legislative: Senate + House leadership
- Judicial: Supreme Court + Courts of Appeals

All data verified from texas.gov and individual agency sites.
Contact info verified current as of 2025-10-08.
Next verification due: 2026-01-08.

Term tracking: 3 officials up for election Nov 2026"
```

**Worker 2: California Agencies** (parallel)
```bash
git worktree add worktrees/agencies/california verification/california-agencies
# ... same workflow ...
```

### No Conflicts
- Each state = separate JSON file
- Workers don't touch each other's files
- Merge to staging when verified
- Promote to main when ready for production

## Integration with FOIA Generator

### Use Case: User Requests Transportation Records

**FOIA Generator Logic**:

1. User selects: "Texas" + "Transportation Records"

2. System queries agencies database:
   ```sql
   SELECT agency_name, contact
   FROM agencies
   WHERE jurisdiction = 'texas'
     AND primary_function LIKE '%transportation%'
   ```

3. Returns: "Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)"
   - Contact: pio@txdot.gov
   - FOIA Portal: txdot.gov/open-records

4. Generator auto-fills request:
   ```
   To: pio@txdot.gov
   Subject: Texas Public Information Act Request

   Dear Texas Department of Transportation Records Officer,

   Pursuant to the Texas Public Information Act (Tex. Gov't Code
   § 552), I request access to the following records:

   [User's request details]

   As per Tex. Gov't Code § 552.221, please respond within 10
   business days...
   ```

### Use Case: User Needs to Appeal Denial

**FOIA Generator Logic**:

1. User: "My request was denied in Oregon. How do I appeal?"

2. System queries:
   ```sql
   SELECT agency_name, contact, special_roles
   FROM agencies
   WHERE jurisdiction = 'oregon'
     AND 'FOIA appeals authority' = ANY(special_roles)
   ```

3. Returns: "Oregon Attorney General"
   - Contact: publicrecords@doj.oregon.gov
   - Special Role: FOIA appeals authority

4. Generator provides appeal guidance:
   ```
   In Oregon, you may appeal to the District Attorney or
   Attorney General. Based on our database, contact:

   Oregon Department of Justice
   Public Records Advocate
   Email: publicrecords@doj.oregon.gov
   Phone: (503) 378-4732

   Appeal deadline: [calculated from statute]
   ```
